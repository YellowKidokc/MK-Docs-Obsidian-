### **6. The Negentropic Purpose Axiom** {#6-negentropic-purpose-axiom}

#### _6.1 Divine Action Modes_

Divine action operates through:

- **Creative Negentropy**: Elevating matter to higher states (e.g., creation of life).
- **Restorative Negentropy**: Reversing decay through grace and redemption.
- **Purposeful Intervention**: Guiding reality toward maximal coherence.

#### _6.2 Miracle Mathematics_

Miracles are not violations of natural laws but expressions of the Logosâ€™s authority over the adversarial field, modeled as entropy-reversing events with measurable information restoration (e.g., R_J in the Grace-Entropy Engine).
