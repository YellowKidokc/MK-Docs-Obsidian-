# The Physics of Faith — in Plain English

## 60-second gist

Reality isn’t random. It’s three layers—**matter**, **life**, and **souls**—held together by one unifying principle: the **Logos** (Jesus). There’s a constant tug-of-war between **coherence** (order, life, truth) and **entropy** (decay, chaos, lies). For rocks and stars, coherence shows up as the laws of physics. For humans, it shows up as **moral alignment**—our choices. Grace is the negentropic force that can _reverse_ decay. The Resurrection is the proof and the destination: perfect, eternal coherence with the Truth.

## Core idea (one line)

**The universe moves toward maximum redemptive coherence; grace makes that possible, and Jesus is the unifying field that ties matter, life, and souls into one story.**

## The tripartite reality (what exists)

- **Matter** (no soul): obeys physical law (gravity, electromagnetism, thermodynamics).
    
- **Living things without a soul**: obey biology/instinct; non-moral.
    
- **Living things with a soul (us)**: obey physics/biology **and** make moral choices that affect spiritual “order vs. decay.”
    

## The two fields (what acts on reality)

- **Adversarial field** → pushes toward entropy/shortcuts/decay.
    
- **Logos field (grace)** → pulls toward coherence/life/truth; overrides entropy (that’s what miracles look like).
    

## The simple rule for souls (how to live)

Choose the **hard path** that builds coherence—truth, love, discipline. Grace supplies the power when we can’t. The “easy shortcut” voice is the adversary; the “do the right hard thing” voice aligns you with the Logos.

## The endpoint (why the Resurrection matters)

Resurrection = **perfect coherence**. Spiritual entropy goes to zero. That’s what eternal life _is_—permanent immunity to decay because you’re fully aligned with Truth.

## Everyday pictures (make it tangible)

- **Storm stilled**: not “breaking nature,” but a higher law (Logos) overruling chaos.
    
- **Healing**: restorative negentropy—order returning to a body.
    
- **Multiplying food**: creative negentropy—elevating matter to serve life.
    
- **Your morning alarm**: shortcut says “sleep in”; coherence says “show up.” Grace is the extra strength to lace the shoes anyway.

## TL;DR

- There’s one story: **from chaos to coherence**.
    
- **Grace** is the engine.
    
- **Your choices** steer.
    
- **Jesus** is the bridge, the rule, and the destination.
