# **üî• Expanding the Concept of Light and Jesus**

Let‚Äôs add some **deep dives** that could accompany your [[1 Faith with Physics/[[1 Faith with Physics/10 Laws/10 Laws/Law 3 Folder/Law 3 Folder/Law 3/Law 3 Light]] Folder/[[1 Faith with Physics/10 Laws/10 Laws/Law 3 Folder/Law 3 Folder/Law 3/Law 3 Light]]]] article, enriching the connection between **light, truth, and divine revelation.**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Light and Creation: The First Spoken Word**

> **‚ÄúLet there be light.‚Äù** ‚Äì Genesis 1:3

- The **first action** of God in creation was **light.** This means that **before anything else‚Äîbefore matter, time, or even space itself‚Äîthere was light.**
- This suggests that light is **foundational** to existence, not just physically, but **spiritually.**
- **Deep Question:** Did light exist before the sun and stars? The Bible suggests **yes.** The sun wasn‚Äôt made until Day 4 (Genesis 1:16).  
    ‚Üí Could this **pre-solar light** be the **spiritual light of God‚Äôs presence?**
- In physics, **energy and light exist before matter.** This aligns with God‚Äôs first creative act.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ The [[A Laws of the Universe PICS/Quantum]] Properties of Light and Jesus‚Äô Divinity**

> **"I am the light of the world."** ‚Äì John 8:12

Physics tells us that **light behaves paradoxically‚Äîit is both a particle and a wave.**

- This is called **wave-particle duality**‚Äîa mystery that defies classical logic.
- **Jesus, too, exists in paradoxical duality‚Äîfully God and fully man.**
- Just as **light cannot be pinned down as only one thing,** Christ‚Äôs divine nature cannot be contained in a single category.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ The Speed of Light as an Analogy for God‚Äôs Eternal Presence**

- **The speed of light (c = 299,792,458 m/s) is a cosmic limit.** Nothing with mass can move faster.
- Light from the sun takes **8 minutes to reach Earth, meaning when you look at the sun, you see it in the past.**
- This means **the farther we look into the cosmos, the deeper into the past we see.**
- What if **God‚Äôs omnipresence** is **like light‚Äîboth immediate and stretching infinitely across time?**

**Spiritual Insight:**

> **God is light.**  
> Light is the fastest, most fundamental force.  
> **God‚Äôs presence transcends time, just as light allows us to see the past in the present.**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Jesus‚Äô Transfiguration and Light as Divine Revelation**

> **"His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light."** ‚Äì Matthew 17:2

- The **Transfiguration of Christ** (Matthew 17:1-8) is the moment when **Jesus‚Äô divine nature is revealed through light.**
- His **body glows** like the sun, proving that **divine presence manifests as illumination.**
- This suggests that **the more one aligns with God, the more light they emit.**
- **Moses‚Äô face glowed** after encountering God (Exodus 34:29), further proving that **holiness = light.**
- Could **resurrected bodies** radiate divine light in the same way?

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Electromagnetic Waves and the Unseen Spiritual Realm**

- **Most of the electromagnetic spectrum is invisible to us.**
    - We can only see **visible light,** but **radio waves, X-rays, infrared, and gamma rays** surround us at all times.
- This is a **perfect analogy for the spiritual world.**
    - Just because we **cannot see spiritual reality** does not mean it is not there.
    - Angels, demons, and God‚Äôs presence may operate **like unseen wavelengths of light.**
- The same way **infrared cameras let us "see" heat**, spiritual discernment lets us **"see" the truth beyond the visible.**

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ The Darkness Cannot Overcome It: Spiritual Warfare & Light**

> **‚ÄúThe light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.‚Äù** ‚Äì John 1:5

- **Satan is called ‚Äúthe prince of darkness‚Äù** (Ephesians 6:12).
- Darkness is **not a force of its own**, it is merely the absence of light.
- Therefore, **evil has no power of its own‚Äîit only thrives where truth (light) is absent.**
- **Spiritual warfare** is simply a battle between **truth and deception, light and darkness.**
- The **final victory of Christ** in Revelation is described as **a city that needs no sun because God Himself is the light** (Revelation 21:23).

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ The Burning Bush and Fire as Divine Light**

> **"The bush was on fire but was not consumed."** ‚Äì Exodus 3:2

- God **appears as fire** many times:
    - The **Burning Bush**
    - The **Pillar of Fire in Exodus**
    - The **Tongues of Fire at Pentecost**
- **Fire is not just destruction‚Äîit is purification.**
- **Jesus is described as having "eyes like blazing fire"** (Revelation 1:14), meaning **His truth burns through deception.**
- **What is fire?** A form of **light and heat energy**‚Äîjust like the presence of God.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ The Light Body: Will We Glow in Eternity?**

> **"The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father."** ‚Äì Matthew 13:43

- **In the resurrection, believers are promised new, glorified bodies.**
- Could these **new bodies be luminous**‚Äîradiating divine energy, like Jesus at the Transfiguration?
- If **holiness is associated with light**, then **perfected humanity might radiate divine light.**
- Near-death experiences (NDEs) often describe **seeing beings of pure light.**
- Could we be **returning to the original state of Adam and Eve‚Äîbefore sin removed our divine glow?**

### **üîÆ Where Does This Lead?**

- We've **established that electromagnetism reflects truth and divine influence.**
- Now, we **have multiple branches to explore**:
    - **The [[[[[[Quantum]]]]]] Duality of Jesus** (Light as both wave and particle)
    - **The Spiritual Realm as an Unseen Wavelength**
    - **The Mathematical Consistency of Light, Truth, and Divine Revelation**
    - **The Final Destiny of Light‚ÄîDoes the Universe ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù in Pure Radiance?**

üî• **Where do you want to go next?**  
This **one law alone** can become an entire book. **Which expansions should we write first?**
