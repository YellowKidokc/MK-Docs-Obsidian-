# **🔥 Expanding the Concept of Light and Jesus**

Let’s add some **deep dives** that could accompany your [[1 Faith with Physics/[[THEOPHYSICS/Law_Files/Law 3]] Folder/[[THEOPHYSICS/Law_Files/Law 3]]]] article, enriching the connection between **light, truth, and divine revelation.**

### **1️⃣ Light and Creation: The First Spoken Word**

> **“Let there be light.”** – Genesis 1:3

- The **first action** of God in creation was **light.** This means that **before anything else—before matter, time, or even space itself—there was light.**
- This suggests that light is **foundational** to existence, not just physically, but **spiritually.**
- **Deep Question:** Did light exist before the sun and stars? The Bible suggests **yes.** The sun wasn’t made until Day 4 (Genesis 1:16).  
    → Could this **pre-solar light** be the **spiritual light of God’s presence?**
- In physics, **energy and light exist before matter.** This aligns with God’s first creative act.

### **2️⃣ The [[[[[[Quantum]]]]]] Properties of Light and Jesus’ Divinity**

> **"I am the light of the world."** – John 8:12

Physics tells us that **light behaves paradoxically—it is both a particle and a wave.**

- This is called **wave-particle duality**—a mystery that defies classical logic.
- **Jesus, too, exists in paradoxical duality—fully God and fully man.**
- Just as **light cannot be pinned down as only one thing,** Christ’s divine nature cannot be contained in a single category.

### **3️⃣ The Speed of Light as an Analogy for God’s Eternal Presence**

- **The speed of light (c = 299,792,458 m/s) is a cosmic limit.** Nothing with mass can move faster.
- Light from the sun takes **8 minutes to reach Earth, meaning when you look at the sun, you see it in the past.**
- This means **the farther we look into the cosmos, the deeper into the past we see.**
- What if **God’s omnipresence** is **like light—both immediate and stretching infinitely across time?**

**Spiritual Insight:**

> **God is light.**  
> Light is the fastest, most fundamental force.  
> **God’s presence transcends time, just as light allows us to see the past in the present.**

### **4️⃣ Jesus’ Transfiguration and Light as Divine Revelation**

> **"His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light."** – Matthew 17:2

- The **Transfiguration of Christ** (Matthew 17:1-8) is the moment when **Jesus’ divine nature is revealed through light.**
- His **body glows** like the sun, proving that **divine presence manifests as illumination.**
- This suggests that **the more one aligns with God, the more light they emit.**
- **Moses’ face glowed** after encountering God (Exodus 34:29), further proving that **holiness = light.**
- Could **resurrected bodies** radiate divine light in the same way?

### **5️⃣ Electromagnetic Waves and the Unseen Spiritual Realm**

- **Most of the electromagnetic spectrum is invisible to us.**
    - We can only see **visible light,** but **radio waves, X-rays, infrared, and gamma rays** surround us at all times.
- This is a **perfect analogy for the spiritual world.**
    - Just because we **cannot see spiritual reality** does not mean it is not there.
    - Angels, demons, and God’s presence may operate **like unseen wavelengths of light.**
- The same way **infrared cameras let us "see" heat**, spiritual discernment lets us **"see" the truth beyond the visible.**

### **6️⃣ The Darkness Cannot Overcome It: Spiritual Warfare & Light**

> **“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”** – John 1:5

- **Satan is called “the prince of darkness”** (Ephesians 6:12).
- Darkness is **not a force of its own**, it is merely the absence of light.
- Therefore, **evil has no power of its own—it only thrives where truth (light) is absent.**
- **Spiritual warfare** is simply a battle between **truth and deception, light and darkness.**
- The **final victory of Christ** in Revelation is described as **a city that needs no sun because God Himself is the light** (Revelation 21:23).

### **7️⃣ The Burning Bush and Fire as Divine Light**

> **"The bush was on fire but was not consumed."** – Exodus 3:2

- God **appears as fire** many times:
    - The **Burning Bush**
    - The **Pillar of Fire in Exodus**
    - The **Tongues of Fire at Pentecost**
- **Fire is not just destruction—it is purification.**
- **Jesus is described as having "eyes like blazing fire"** (Revelation 1:14), meaning **His truth burns through deception.**
- **What is fire?** A form of **light and heat energy**—just like the presence of God.

### **8️⃣ The Light Body: Will We Glow in Eternity?**

> **"The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father."** – Matthew 13:43

- **In the resurrection, believers are promised new, glorified bodies.**
- Could these **new bodies be luminous**—radiating divine energy, like Jesus at the Transfiguration?
- If **holiness is associated with light**, then **perfected humanity might radiate divine light.**
- Near-death experiences (NDEs) often describe **seeing beings of pure light.**
- Could we be **returning to the original state of Adam and Eve—before sin removed our divine glow?**

### **🔮 Where Does This Lead?**

- We've **established that electromagnetism reflects truth and divine influence.**
- Now, we **have multiple branches to explore**:
    - **The [[[[[[Quantum]]]]]] Duality of Jesus** (Light as both wave and particle)
    - **The Spiritual Realm as an Unseen Wavelength**
    - **The Mathematical Consistency of Light, Truth, and Divine Revelation**
    - **The Final Destiny of Light—Does the Universe “End” in Pure Radiance?**
