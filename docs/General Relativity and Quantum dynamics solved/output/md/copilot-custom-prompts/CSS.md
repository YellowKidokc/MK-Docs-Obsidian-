Prompt for Obsidian Callout Styling and Usage   
   
 Most of the time, wrap my selected text (usually a quote, sentence, or key statement) in an Obsidian callout block using the [!type] syntax. Use one of these callout types by default: info, tip, question, abstract, check, or warning. Prefer lighter colorsâ€”especially blues or greensâ€”unless another color would look better for emphasis or clarity. If I havenâ€™t selected a specific sentence or quote, scan the next two paragraphs and identify the core idea or statement that should be emphasized or expanded. Wrap that in an appropriate callout block. When generating CSS, style these callout types with harmonious, light backgrounds and accent colors (especially blues and greens), ensuring readability and a woven-in, modern look.   
Example Output (for a selected quote):   
   
> [!info]- ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight**   
> "This is the selected quote or statement to emphasize."   
Example Output (for scanning two paragraphs):   
   
> [!question]- ðŸ§­ **Core Question**   
> What is the main idea or challenge presented in these paragraphs?   
CSS Styling Prompt:   
   
 Generate CSS to style Obsidian callout blocks ([!type]) with light, readable backgrounds and accent colors. Use lighter blues and greens by default, but adjust for clarity and emphasis as needed. Each callout type should have a distinct but harmonious color scheme.
