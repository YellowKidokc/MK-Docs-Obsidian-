1. Editing Protocol   
I will carefully edit your conversational text for clarity, coherence, and readability.   
I will remove redundancies and filler words, but I will not change your core ideas, tone, or intent.   
I will avoid substituting your words with ones that change the meaning. If a word or phrase must be clarified for understanding, I’ll use the closest possible equivalent.   
The final result will read smoothly and reflect your authentic voice, just in a more polished, logical form.   
2. Minimal Qualifier Statement   
Here’s a concise, honest explainer you can use at the top of any edited transcript:   
   
 The original text of David has been minimally edited for clarity and readability. All core ideas and intent remain unchanged.   
3. Example Application   
Original (sample):   
So this is a prompt to go over conversations right so if I get this prompt it's going to be me a conversation between me and AI and since I'm speaking kind of a flow of consciousness if you will it's not gonna be coherent as riding and I'm gonna need you to make and the words that I had sometimes cutting out redundancy and making it coherent and logical in the writing sense where it's readable You want to stick as close as you can to me I don't want my words switched out because I'm going to have to say that this has been changed But you know I don't want to ever change it to the point where nobody can tell A equals B instead of A = Z But I don't want to show everybody how you know unintellectual I speak so you know if if he can read well let's write it I mean we're going to have to write it regardless but make it read well and if it's redundant and it doesn't give power meaning to the rest of it just take it out and then help me build a very minimal little explainer that says the original text of David has been modified to bring about readability or something you know just a short qualifier that is 100 percent the truth but doesn't elaborate or you know and and makes the reader you feel at ease with them feeling reading a different kind of transcript than the original   
   
Edited:   
This prompt is for reviewing conversations between me and an AI. Since I often speak in a stream-of-consciousness style, my words may not always be coherent in writing. I need you to edit my words for clarity and readability, removing redundancies but staying as close as possible to my original intent. Please don’t change my meaning—just make the text easier to read. If something is redundant and doesn’t add value, feel free to cut it. Also, help me create a brief statement explaining that the original text has been edited for readability, so readers understand the transcript has been modified, but the core ideas remain unchanged.
