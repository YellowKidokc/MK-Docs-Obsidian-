### **The Physics of Faith: An Everyday Breakdown**   
   
Imagine the universe isn't just a random collection of matter, but a system with a built-in purpose. At its core, there are three distinct parts to reality:   
   
1. **The Physical World:** All the stuff that doesn't have a soul—rocks, stars, oceans. These things follow the fundamental laws of nature, like gravity and thermodynamics.   
       
2. **The Living World:** All of creation that lives and breathes but doesn't have a soul—plants and animals. They follow the laws of nature, but also the laws of biology and instinct.   
       
3. **The Spiritual World:** Humanity. We follow the physical and biological laws, but we have a soul. This gives us the ability to make choices that matter on a different level.   
       
   
Now, imagine there are two opposing forces at work in this three-part reality:   
   
   
- **The Force of Chaos:** This is a spiritual force that acts like a cosmic rust. Its purpose is to increase entropy—disorder, decay, and sickness. We see its effects in everything from a crumbling building to a body ravaged by illness.   
       
   
- **The Force of Coherence:** This is the spiritual force of God, the Logos. Its purpose is to increase order, life, and unity. We see its effects in a thriving ecosystem, the birth of a child, and in moments of profound peace.   
       
   
Here's the "ringer" that ties it all together: **Jesus is the ultimate Force of Coherence.**   
   
Because he is the creator of the entire system, he has the ultimate authority over all three parts of reality.   
   
   
- When he performed miracles on **the physical world**, he wasn't breaking the laws of nature. He was demonstrating that his authority, as the ultimate force of coherence, is a higher law that can override the chaos and decay of the universe.   
       
   
- When he performed miracles on **the living world** (healing the sick), he was directly reversing the effects of chaos, restoring order and life.   
       
   
- When it comes to **the spiritual world** (us), the battle is fought in our choices. We can choose to align with the force of coherence or the force of chaos.   
       
   
This brings us to the ultimate point: **The Purpose of the Resurrection.**   
   
The Resurrection is the ultimate victory of coherence over chaos. It is a cosmic phase change that shows a reality can exist where chaos is completely eliminated. For those who choose to align with Jesus, his grace—his blood—acts as the ultimate "anti-chaos" force, allowing our souls to be made perfectly coherent with the Truth. This perfect coherence is what grants us eternal life, a state where the force of chaos and decay has no power over us.
