# 🔮 Digital Payment & Identity Systems: Prophecy Fulfillment Analysis (2020-2025)   
   
## **📋 Executive Summary**   
   
This analysis examines the rapid acceleration of global digital payment and identity systems from 2020-2025, evaluating their alignment with biblical prophecy regarding the "Mark of the Beast" economic control system (Revelation 13:16-17). The evidence shows unprecedented convergence toward a cashless, globally integrated, biometrically-controlled financial infrastructure that could enable the prophetic scenario of "no one can buy or sell" without proper authorization.
