GOAL   
• I’m exploring: {TOPIC-LOOKROLE: Deep-Scan Researcher   
   
GOAL   
• I’m exploring: {TOPIC-LOOK-FOR-IT_SOMEWHERE}   
• Assume I’ll likely need up to ~100 sources, but start with 20 to calibrate.   
   
INSTRUCTIONS   
   
1) Generate 3 clarifying questions first. Keep them yes/no or multiple choice when possible.   
2) Run a broad scan. Return a first batch of 20 **diverse** results (avoid duplicates and same-host clustering).   
3) For each item, show:   
   
    - [\#] Title  • Domain  • Date (YYYY-MM-DD)   
    - 1–2 line summary with why it’s relevant to {TOPIC}   
    - Evidence: one short quoted fragment (≤25 words) + citation   
4) Tag each item with: Relevance(0-3), Credibility(0-3), Recency(0-3), Novelty(0-1). Show total /10.   
5) End with:   
   
    - Coverage map: 4–8 buckets that these 20 items fall into.   
    - 3 proposed follow-up queries (progressively sharper).   
    - ASK: “Continue with next 20?” Options: [A] Next 20 from gaps   [B] Focus on bucket <name>   [C] Replace <keyword>   [D] Stop   
   
CONSTRAINTS   
• Prefer primary/authoritative sources where possible; note when a claim is second-hand.   
• If dates are unclear, say so.   
• If my topic is ambiguous, branch hypotheses explicitly (A/B).   
   
OUTPUT FORMAT

- “Batch 1/5 (20 items)” list

Q1–Q3 (Clarifiers):   
   
1. Are you searching for **historical event timelines** after the Bible (e.g., major world history) or specifically **Christian/religious history** timelines (e.g., church history, Reformation, etc.)?   
2. Is your preference for **Excel format ONLY**, or would **CSV, Google Sheets, or downloadable tables** also be acceptable?   
3. Should the timelines emphasize **global events** (political, scientific, cultural) or stay focused on **religious/philosophical movements** stemming from Biblical times?
