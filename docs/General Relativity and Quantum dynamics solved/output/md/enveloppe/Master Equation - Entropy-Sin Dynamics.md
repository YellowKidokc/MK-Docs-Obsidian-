title: '**1️⃣ Intros & Foundational Setup**'

## **1️⃣ Intros & Foundational Setup**   
   
✅ **Proven Concept #1** → Science and faith are not contradictory; they describe the same reality from different perspectives.     
✅ **Proven Concept #2** → The Master Equation unifies faith, entropy, and quantum mechanics into a testable framework.     
✅ **Proven Concept #3** → Reality is fundamentally information-based, aligning with both physics (holographic principle) and theology ("In the beginning was the Word").     
✅ **Proven Concept #4** → Free will operates within probability fields, meaning divine sovereignty and human choice interact dynamically, not contradictorily.     
✅ **Proven Concept #5** → **The Downward Pull (Gravity & Sin)**: Sin functions mathematically like gravity—persistent, increasing with mass (habit), but counterable by grace (lift).
