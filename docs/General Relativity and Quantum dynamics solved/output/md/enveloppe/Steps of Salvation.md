I don't know about you but I'm It's going to take a minute and get it burned to that **** up in the oven ## **For the Deeper Seeker: Exploring the Cosmic-Spiritual Connection**   
   
![Mp3note - Feb 28 2025 20-48.mp3](Mp3note%20-%20Feb%2028%202025%2020-48.mp3)   
# **🔷 Step 1: Establishing Universal Agreement**   
   
Start where **everyone agrees**:   
   
✅ **Do you believe in good and evil?** → Most people say yes.     
✅ **For sake of argument, let’s say Satan = evil and God = good.**   
   
At this point, you **haven’t preached**—you just set a **logical framework** that people already agree on.   
   
   
---   
   
## **🔷 Step 2: The Question That Changes Everything**   
   
Now hit them with the **unavoidable question**:   
   
> **Deep down, do you believe that good is more powerful than evil?**   
   
✔ **If they say yes → They already believe in God’s victory, they just haven’t realized it yet.**     
✔ **If they say no → Then life is meaningless, and they have no reason to hope.**   
   
🔥 **Either way, they are confronted with the reality of ultimate truth.**

### **🔷 Step 3: The Final Trap – The Resurrection as Proof**   
   
Now, **tie it back** to Jesus:   
   
> If good is stronger than evil… then **there must be a moment when that was proven.**     
> The **greatest battle** between good and evil **is death**.     
> If Jesus died and stayed dead, then **evil won**.     
> If He came back, then **good won, permanently.**   
   
   
---   
   
### **🚀 Breaking It Down with Logic**   
   
#### **🔢 Can we quantify the odds of resurrection?**   
   
> **Statistical Probability:**     
> Let’s assume **all humans die and stay dead** → Probability of resurrection = **effectively 0%**.   
   
But **this changes** when:     
1️⃣ **Multiple eyewitnesses claimed to see Him alive.**     
2️⃣ **Skeptics (like Paul) suddenly converted based on these claims.**     
3️⃣ **The Roman & Jewish authorities couldn’t disprove it—when they had every reason to.**     
4️⃣ **The entire world changed based on this one event.**   
   
> Mathematically speaking:     
> If **one** resurrection happened, then **it is no longer a probability of 0**.   
   
Meaning:     
✅ If **Jesus actually rose**, then **death is not final.**     
✅ If **Jesus actually rose**, then **evil was defeated in a way that had never been seen before.**     
✅ If **Jesus actually rose**, then **He is what He claimed to be—God in the flesh.**   
   
   
---   
   
### **🔷 The Unescapable Conclusion**   
   
**If good is stronger than evil,** then there **must be proof** that good **has actually won** at least once.   
   
> 🔥 **The resurrection is that proof.**   
   
If Jesus rose, then **evil’s greatest weapon—death—has already lost.**   
   
Which means…     
✔ **God wins.**     
✔ **Good is ultimate.**     
✔ **Your choice is clear: Stand with victory, or remain in defeat.**

### **🛠 The Final Algorithm for the Soul**   
   
✅ **Do you believe in good and evil?** (Most say yes.)     
✅ **Do you believe good is stronger than evil?** (Most want to say yes.)     
✅ **What’s the greatest battle between good and evil?** → **Life vs. Death.**     
✅ **What happens if someone actually conquered death?** → **Good wins forever.**     
✅ **If that already happened (Jesus’ resurrection), then what does that mean for you?**   
   
🔥 **This is unbreakable.** They either **accept that Jesus defeated death**, or they **admit they believe evil wins.**   
   
> **There is no neutral ground.**

### **🚀 Why This Is a Perfect Soul Algorithm**   
   
✔ **It forces people into self-reflection before they ever reject Christianity.**     
✔ **It makes them realize what they already believe (about good & evil).**     
✔ **It ties faith to ultimate victory, not just abstract religion.**     
✔ **It makes them confront the resurrection as history—not just doctrine.**   
   
🔥 **Bro, we’re not just asking people to believe. We’re forcing them to realize what’s already true.**   
   
   
   
OK I think it's more simple in the sense that scripture is clear on what is meant to be clear on that we are sinners that we need a savior that we cannot save ourselves and that God himself steps out of eternity and into humanity into depravity and the 2nd person of the Trinity in Jesus and takes the penalty for our wrongdoing for the evil that exists here we're very concerned with the evil out there but there's a lot of evil in here and Jesus takes that upon himself on the cross And I think when I study world religions what I find interesting is that all world religions amount to either an aspect of mercy or justice so I would say if you look at something like a lot of the eastern philosophies that have karma incorporated within them it is wholly just right buddhists are trying to break the cycle of Samsara they're trying to Sarah so Samsara is the cycle of birth life death and rebirth Ok so the purpose of Buddhism is to seek enlightenment in things like the 7 noble truths the 8th full path In realizing that it's your attachment to desire in the physical world that is that is rooting you in that system and that when you realize that you can release desire Then you can become one with the universe right so they're they're seeking to destroy The self in that sense That's but the system that operates on that in Karma is just the same thing in in terms of its iteration with an Hinduism it's just you do get your just punishment what you in this life either good or bad reflects in the next life Whereas I would look at Islam as one that is merciful in the sense that every chapter of the Koran except for 1 starts off with this phrase Bismolah god the most benevolent the most merciful however I think when you study world religions one thing You see is that the justice of karma is at the expense of mercy and the mercy of Islam is at the expense of justice so mercy is not getting what you do deserve So Karma doesn't allow for mercy you will always go you deserve a Islam the god of Islam forgives but I would argue that he forgives arbitrarily and that his law Is not accounted for there is no justice for when the law is broken he just forgives it but what about the justice in that situation what about the person who's been wronged what about on Christianity though you can offer giving God that's what I'm getting at so I think this is the one of the things that people don't often realize about Christianity is mercy and justice are perfectly are perfectly measured in that when Christ takes the penalty that we deserve the full wrath of God It is put on Jesus on the cross so it's not just the physical that Jesus experiences with the crucifixion which is pretty terrible but he actually experiences all of the sin that we commit on himself and in that sense God's law is fulfilled in its justice and because it's fulfilled now because Christ gets the punishment we deserve now we get what we don't deserve in mercy But God's law is not broken he doesn't just forgive it right because God is a holy God and he cannot just forgive at random because forgiveness is costly but forgiveness is not costly for the god of Islam he can just do it but if I you know knock over all these cameras and break them and you say W that sucks but you know what it's okay you didn't mean to do it i'm going to go get out of you yeah right But for this hypothetical situation there's still a cost it's just not on me it's on you right But you have been merciful to me but that that forgiveness is very costly to you and So what we've seen Christianity is that the cost of the punishment of sin is fulfilled christ takes that upon himself knowing that we cannot do it and then mercy is given out and not just mercy but grace so mercy is not getting what you do deserve grace is getting what you don't deserve so mercy is you deserve synonym you don't get it any longer But now not only are you forgiven but God then adopts you as a child you don't deserve that so you're not just forgiven you are adopted into his family and given eternal life Maybe it's getting late and I'm getting twisted in my head now jerk but like the concept of grace and Christianity does not tie back to the early concept you were talking there about the just forgiving God in in the Koran In Islam no because Grace is a gift so inherently to what it is is because God's law has been fulfilled and it doesn't just go unjustly punished right so if you committed a heinous crime and you stood at the seat of the judge and the judge said Julian you're a good guy he got no priors i'm just going to let you go right that would be merciful but everybody would be like dude like what what about the what about justice right or if he said I know you have no priors but you're pretty terrible i'm going to throw the book at you right life in prison we're going to there's no death penalty but we're going to try to reform the system in order to get the death penalty right that would be justice to the extreme but it would not be merciful Eye for an eye so now if the judge not only says OK you're forgiven but I'm going to pay the penalty i'm going to pay the fine i'm going to go to prison for whatever the the conviction is and then you're going to be able to stay in my house as for my children Right that's grace you're not just being let off the hook you're being given something being given something you don't deserve and so within Christianity I you have something that's inherently unique in that in all other systems of religiosity it's some form of survival of the fittest Rated some form up do this and you're accepted feel this and you're accepted or think this and you're accepted right of intellectualism emotionalism now what what were we saying what what did I have to do oh yeah thank you I was a smoke shop do you have little baggies to put my dope in no no not with them they're stuck they are stuck up yesterday no no well I mean I get it I mean I want to I probably
