---
   
### **🔑 The Absolute Must-Happen Events for the Antichrist to Rise**   
   
These are the **bare minimum events** that allow him to take power:   
   
1. **Revival of the Roman Empire (Global Government Formation)** – _Daniel 7:7, 24; Revelation 13:1_   
       
   
    - A new global power structure forms (likely in Europe).   
    - Antichrist emerges as one of its leaders.   
2. **Global Chaos & Crisis (Economic/War/Pandemic Disasters)** – _Matthew 24:6-7_   
       
   
    - The world **must be in a desperate state** to accept him.   
    - This includes **wars, economic collapse, and global instability.**   
3. **Seven-Year Peace Treaty with Israel** – _Daniel 9:27_   
       
   
    - The Antichrist **confirms a peace treaty** with Israel.   
    - This **officially starts the 7-year Tribulation**.   
4. **Formation of a One-World Religion** – _Revelation 17:1-5_   
       
   
    - A **global religious system** is set up.   
    - This helps unite the world **under false spirituality**.   
5. **Economic System Shift (Mark of the Beast Setup)** – _Revelation 13:16-17_   
       
   
    - A system emerges where **people can’t buy or sell** without a mark.   
    - This gives the Antichrist **full control over daily life**.
