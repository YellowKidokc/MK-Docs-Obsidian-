# Physics-Faith Concept Mapper   
   
This is a backup copy of the Physics-Faith Concept Mapper project. This tool analyzes markdown files in the Law folders to identify concepts and connections between physics and faith concepts.   
   
## Files Included   
   
   
- `Physics-Faith Concept Mapper.py` - The main Python script   
- `concept_categories.py` - Contains definitions of concept categories   
- `related_terms.py` - Contains definitions of related terms   
- `bidirectional_connections.py` - Contains bidirectional connections between physics and faith concepts   
- `utils.py` - Contains utility functions   
- `run_concept_mapper.bat` - Original batch file (may not work with UNC paths)   
- `run_concept_mapper_local.bat` - Modified batch file that works with local paths   
- `Law 1-4 folders` - Contains markdown files with concept maps   
   
## How to Run   
   
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system   
2. Run the script using the batch file:   
```
   run_concept_mapper_local.bat
```
   
   
This will process all markdown files in the Law folders and generate concept maps in the Academy folder.   
   
## Output   
   
The script generates the following files in the Academy folder:   
   
   
- Concept Inventory.md - A comprehensive inventory of concepts used across the Laws   
- Cross-Law Connections.md - Maps connections between Laws based on shared concepts   
- Concept Network Visualization.md - Visualizations of the concept network   
- concept_data.json - JSON export of the concept data for further analysis   
- Keyword Matrix.md - A matrix of keywords and their relationships   
- Connection Ideas.md - Specific connection ideas for research   
   
## Customization   
   
You can customize the script by modifying:   
   
   
- `concept_categories.py` - Add or modify concept categories   
- `related_terms.py` - Add or modify related terms   
- `bidirectional_connections.py` - Add or modify bidirectional connections   
   
## Troubleshooting   
   
If you encounter any issues:   
   
1. Make sure Python is installed and in your PATH   
2. Check that all required files are in the same directory   
3. Ensure the Law folders contain markdown files
