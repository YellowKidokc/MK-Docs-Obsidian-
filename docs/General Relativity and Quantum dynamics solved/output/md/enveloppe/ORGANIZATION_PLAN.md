# Law Files Organization Plan   
   
## Target Structure   
Based on your requirements, here's the organizational framework:   
   
### Content Categories   
1. **FAQ** - Frequent ask questions   
2. **Executive Summary** - High level overview   
3. **Mind Maps** - Visual conceptual frameworks   
4. **Podcast Audio** - Audio content for general audience   
5. **Law Audio** - Audio content for legal/academic audience   
6. **Deep Research** - Technical/academic backing papers   
7. **Deeper Beliefs/Upsell** - Advanced theological concepts   
   
### Naming Convention   
   
- **LW** (Law prefix)   
- **##** (Law number: 01-10)   
- **Category Code**:   
  - FAQ = FQ   
  - Executive Summary = ES   
  - Mind Map = MM   
  - Podcast Audio = PA   
  - Law Audio = LA   
  - Deep Research = DR   
  - Deeper Beliefs = DB   
  - Main Document = MD   
  - Introduction = IN   
  - Story = ST   
  - Concept Map = CM   
  - Meta = MT   
   
Examples:   
   
- LW-01-ES-GravitySin.md (Law 1 Executive Summary)   
- LW-03-MM-LightTruth.md (Law 3 Mind Map)   
- LW-07-DR-QuantumRelativity.md (Law 7 Deep Research)   
   
## Current File Analysis   
Found approximately 400+ files in various categories:   
   
### By Law Number:   
   
- Law 1: ~80 files (Gravity/Sin)   
- Law 2: ~60 files (Nuclear Force/Unity)     
- Law 3: ~70 files (Electromagnetism/Light)   
- Law 4: ~30 files (Weak Force)   
- Law 5: ~40 files (Thermodynamics)   
- Law 6: ~35 files (Cause & Effect)   
- Law 7: ~45 files (Quantum/Uncertainty)   
- Law 8: ~25 files (Phase Transitions)   
- Law 9: ~20 files (Multiple Forces)   
- Law 10: ~15 files (Unified Framework)   
   
### By Content Type:   
   
- Main Documents: ~10 primary papers   
- Comprehensive Concept Maps: ~40 versions   
- Meta documents: ~60 analysis papers   
- Introductions: ~10 intro papers   
- Stories/narratives: ~15 story documents   
- Templates: ~20 template files   
- Research papers: ~30 research documents   
- Cross-references: ~15 connection papers   
   
### Duplicate Pattern Analysis:   
   
- Many files have numbered versions (1), (2), (3), etc.   
- Some have descriptive suffixes   
- Multiple template attempts   
- Various organizational schemes attempted   
   
## Organization Strategy:   
1. **Preserve originals** in reference folder   
2. **Identify best versions** of each content type   
3. **Rename systematically** with LW convention   
4. **Categorize by target structure**   
5. **Flag missing content types**   
6. **Mark duplicates for review**   
   
## Next Steps:   
1. Create systematic file inventory   
2. Identify the "best" version of each paper type   
3. Rename and organize into target structure   
4. Generate gap analysis report   
5. Create publication-ready versions
