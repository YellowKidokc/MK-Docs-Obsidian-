# Timelines :: Arms Control Treaties   
   
Arms Control: For over 100 years now man has attempted to find ways to reduce the chances of warfare. Because he refuses to seek God’s help, the Bible predicts man’s efforts at arms control will eventually fail.

**1979**     
SALT II, signed in Vienna by the U.S. and USSR, constrains offensive nuclear weapons, limiting each side to 2,400 missile launchers and heavy bombers, with that ceiling to apply until January 1, 1985. The treaty also sets a combined total of 1,320 ICBMs and SLBMs with multiple warheads on each side. Although approved by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the treaty never reaches the Senate floor because President Jimmy Carter withdraws his support for the treaty following the December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet troops.

It bans all US/USSR ballistic missiles and U.S. GLCM w/ ranges b/t 500 and 5500 Kilometers and provides for the destruction of all such existing weapons (only cuts nuclear arsenals by 4 percent)   
   
**1988**     
Ballistic Missile Launch Notification Agreement, a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and USSR, requires each nation to notify the other party “no less than twenty-four hours in advance, of the planned date, launch area, and area of impact for any launch of a strategic ballistic missile.”   
   
**1991**     
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) is signed in Moscow by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President George Bush to reduce strategic offensive arms by approximately 30 percent in three phases over seven years.

**1992**     
The Open Skies Treaty, a complex agreement, allows for the exchange of observation flights over the territories of nations that are members of the pact.   
   
**1993**     
START II is signed by Bush and Yeltsin calling for both sides to reduce long-range nuclear arsenals by approximately one-third over the next decade and will entirely eliminate land-based, multiple-warhead missiles.

**On July 25,** Russia says the next round of negotiations with the United States on a new deal to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) will take place by early September.The leaders sign a statement instructing negotiators to finalize a replacement for the START 1 treaty. The agreement provides for a reduction of warheads from 2,200 to a range of 1,500 to 1,675 and reduces launch vehicles from 1,600 to a range of 500 to 1,100. (VOA)   
   
**2010**The _Washington Post_ reports on July 6, 2010, that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New-Start) with Russia could be the president’s worst foreign policy mistake yet. New-START impedes missile defense, our protection from nuclear-proliferating rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. It explicitly forbids the United States from converting intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos into missile defense sites. New-START gives Russia a massive nuclear weapon advantage over the United States, strongly compromising U.S. missile shield defenses. The treaty ignores tactical nuclear weapons, where Russia outnumbers the U.S. by as much as 10 to 1. New-START Treaty passes in the U.S. Senate on December 22 by a vote of 71-26 and is ratified over Republican concerns and objections.   
   
**2011**Despite much opposition to the bill, President Obama signs the **New-START Treaty** on February 2, reducing U.S. capabilities for self-defense.   
   
2012   
   
**July 25—**Fox News reports that the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) could lead to perpetual attacks on the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment and American foreign policy.   
   
**July 27—**Investigative reporters for Ammoland expose previously unpublished (hidden) documents showing that the controversial ATT, also known as “the small arms treaty,” “includes gun control for private small arms and light weapons,” as U.S. gun owners feared. ATT has been controversial from the start. Gun-rights activists say that the treaty is an attempt by the Obama administration to implement gun control without having to go through Congress to do so. Fifty-eight senators, including thirteen Democrats, sign a letter in opposition to the treaty.   
   
**July 28—**Fox News reports that the UN has failed to reach a deal on the global arms trade treaty, and that the impact of the opposition by U.S. senators has had a marked effect on the inability to pass the treaty. But this is still an ongoing issue, according to the UN.   
   
**2013****On November 20–24,** Iran and five permanent members of the UN Security Council meet in Geneva with Iranian Minister Javad Zarif to hammer out a plan of action on Iran’s nuclear program. The agreed-on accord lays out specific steps for each side in a six-month, first-phase agreement and the broad framework to guide negotiations for a comprehensive solution.

**2014**     
An article published in the May issue of _Arms Control Today_ finds that the world’s nine nuclear-armed states still possess more than ten thousand nuclear warheads combined, and are all seeking to modernize their arsenals. According to the article, the trend has riled a growing number of signatories to the 1968 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which obligates states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. (https://www.armscontrol.org/subject/60/date)   
   
**2015**In July, the U.S. administration and the P5+1 powers incomprehensibly make a deal with the terrorist state of Iran. As a result, the White House will begin assisting the Iranians in furthering their nuclear ambitions and will enable $150 billion to flow into the hands of this terrorist state.   
   
**2016**On October 27, the United Nations adopts a resolution to launch negotiations in 2017 on a treaty outlawing nuclear weapons. This is an attempt to ban nuclear weapons from all nations, including peaceful ones like Israel, which is threatened with extinction daily. The UN does not have power over sovereign nations.   
   
**2017**Just hours before leaving office on Friday January 20, former President Barack Hussein Obama quietly releases $220 million to the Palestinian Authority, funds likely to be used for arms to attack Israel. This is American taxpayer money that the Republican members of Congress had been blocking because of the tyrannical record of the Palestinians. President Donald Trump immediately freezes the release of the money through the State Department.   
   
2018     
Russia violates the INF Treaty by developing and deploying a prohibited intermediate-range cruise missile. In October, President Trump announces that the U.S. will terminate the treaty; NATO backs that decision.   
   
2019     
Trump’s 2018 announcement that the U.S. would terminate the INF Treaty signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed in 1987 became a reality; the U.S. also stated plans to test a missile in the coming weeks that would have been prohibited by that Treaty.   
   
2020     
In February of 2020, a year before the expiration of the New START nuclear arms pact with Moscow, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said the Trump administration will soon begin negotiations with Russia regarding whether the treaty will be extended.
