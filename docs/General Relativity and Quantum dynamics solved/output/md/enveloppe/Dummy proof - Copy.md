**Prompt:**   
   
Develop a Python script using Streamlit to create a multi-page application with a customizable sidebar navigation. The script should address the following:   
   
1. **Intuitive Page Navigation:** Ensure smooth transitions between pages without losing information when switching between them.   
2. **Dynamic Page Loading:** Implement a mechanism to load pages dynamically when selected, minimizing initial load time.   
3. **Progress Tracking and Notes:** Incorporate a section to track progress, record objectives, issues encountered, and solutions implemented for each page or feature.   
4. **"Dummy-Proof" Setup:** Handle virtual environment setup, dependency installation, and provide clear instructions so that anyone can run the application with minimal effort.   
   
**Code:**   
   
Copy Code   
   
```
import streamlit as st
import os
import subprocess
import sys
# ... (Add other necessary imports)

# --- Virtual Environment and Dependency Management ---

def setup_venv():
    # ... (Your existing setup_venv and install_packages functions)

# --- Streamlit GUI ---

def main():
    setup_venv()
    # install_packages("requirements.txt")

    st.set_page_config(page_title="My Application", page_icon=":rocket:")

    # --- Customizable Sidebar Navigation ---
    navigation_options = [
        "Page 1",
        "Page 2",
        "Page 3",
        # ... Add more options
    ]
    
    # Use st.session_state to store the selected page 
    if "selected_page" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.selected_page = navigation_options[0]

    selected_page = st.sidebar.radio(
        "Navigation",
        navigation_options,
        key="selected_page" # Use a key to store the selection in session state
    )

    # --- Page Content ---

    if st.session_state.selected_page == "Page 1":
        page_1_content()
    elif st.session_state.selected_page == "Page 2":
        page_2_content()
    elif st.session_state.selected_page == "Page 3":
        page_3_content()
    # ... Add more elif blocks

    # --- Progress Tracking and Notes ---
    st.sidebar.header("Progress Notes")
    
    # Use st.session_state to store progress notes for each page
    for page_name in navigation_options:
        if f"{page_name}_notes" not in st.session_state:
            st.session_state[f"{page_name}_notes"] = ""

        st.sidebar.markdown(f"**{page_name}:**")
        st.sidebar.text_area(
            "Objectives, Issues, Solutions", 
            key=f"{page_name}_notes", 
            height=150
        )

# --- Page Content Functions ---

def page_1_content():
    st.header("Page 1 Content")
    # ... (Your Streamlit code for Page 1)

def page_2_content():
    st.header("Page 2 Content")
    # ... (Your Streamlit code for Page 2)

def page_3_content():
    st.header("Page 3 Content")
    # ... (Your Streamlit code for Page 3)

# ... Add more functions for other pages

# --- Custom CSS for Button Styling ---

st.markdown(
    """
    <style>
    /* ... (Same CSS as before for button styling) */
    </style>
    """,
    unsafe_allow_html=True
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
   
   
**Explanation of Enhancements:**   
   
1. **Intuitive Page Navigation with `st.session_state`:**   
       
   
    - We use `st.session_state` to store the selected page. This preserves the selection even when the user interacts with other elements on the page or switches between pages.   
    - The `key` parameter in `st.sidebar.radio` is used to link the radio button selection to the `st.session_state`.   
2. **Dynamic Page Loading (Implicit in Streamlit):**   
       
   
    - Streamlit's execution model handles dynamic page loading implicitly. When a user selects a page, only the code for that page's content is executed.   
3. **Progress Tracking and Notes:**   
       
   
    - A "Progress Notes" section is added to the sidebar.   
    - `st.session_state` is used to store notes for each page separately.   
    - `st.sidebar.text_area` provides a text area for entering and saving notes.   
4. **"Dummy-Proof" Setup:**   
       
   
    - The `setup_venv` and `install_packages` functions (from your previous prompt) handle the virtual environment and dependency management, making it easy for anyone to run the application.   
   
**Using the Enhanced Code:**   
   
1. **Customize Navigation Options:** Edit the `navigation_options` list to include your page names.   
2. **Implement Page Content:** Write the Streamlit code for each page's content within the corresponding functions (e.g., `page_1_content`).   
3. **Add Progress Notes:** Use the text areas in the sidebar to record objectives, issues, and solutions for each page.   
4. **Run the Script:** `streamlit run your_script_name.py`   
   
This enhanced code provides a more robust and user-friendly foundation for your Streamlit application, addressing page navigation, dynamic loading, progress tracking, and ease of setup.
