> > The First Law of Universal Gravitation reveals the fundamental principle of attraction that operates across physical, emotional, and spiritual domains. It demonstrates how the same mathematical patterns of attraction manifest from quantum particles to cosmic bodies, and from physical gravity to spiritual connection.
