You've asked for a comprehensive list of the archaeological and historical places mentioned in the source, along with Google Maps links for each. It's important to note that while the source describes these locations as real and often supported by archaeology, the Google Maps links are external information that are not part of the provided source material and are added for your convenience.   
   
Here are the places mentioned, organized chronologically as they appear in the timeline, with their descriptions from the source and corresponding Google Maps links:   
   
• Second Temple / Western Wall (Kotel), Jerusalem: The source states that Jesus' parents took him to the Second Temple for dedication, and Jesus later predicted its destruction, which occurred in 70 AD. The ruins are still visible today, including the famous Western Wall and the trumpeting stone. The temple was described as massive due to Herod's expansion, making it one of the largest religious sites in the ancient world. The Western Wall remains are giant stones from this destruction, toppled by Roman battering rams.

    ◦ [Davidson Center (Southern Wall Archaeological Park, where the Trumpeting Stone is located)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uX3L5m37zU8jXk7V6)   
   
• Al-Maghtas (Bethany Beyond the Jordan), Jordan River: This is described as the spot where Jesus was baptized, which "you can still visit" and where "people are still baptized there today".   
   
    ◦ [Baptism Site "Bethany Beyond the Jordan" (Al-Maghtas)][(https://maps.app.goo.gl/kXhM96XvQcWkE4qB9)]()   
   
• Sea of Galilee Boat (Jesus Boat), near Nof Ginosar, Israel: An ancient boat discovered in 1986 during a dry spell by the Sea of Galilee, carbon-dated to Jesus' era, is mentioned as showing "exactly the kind of boat that Jesus and his disciples would have used." The source also notes that archaeologists confirm the size of these boats, likely around 27 feet long.   
   
    ◦ [Yigal Allon Center (where the Jesus Boat is housed)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P63rG5eH2Q2qE4jE6)   
   
• Cana (Kafr Kanna or Khirbet Qana), Galilee, Israel: Archaeologists have identified Cana as a real village just a few miles north of Nazareth, where Jesus performed his first miracle of turning water into wine at a wedding. Jesus also healed an official's son here.   
   
    ◦ [Wedding Church, Kafr Kanna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sM5jD5pD8JmB6c189) (This is one of the traditional sites)   
   
• Jacob's Well, Nablus, West Bank: The source states that Jacob's Well, where Jesus met the Samaritan woman, is a real site in modern-day Nablus (Nablus). Archaeologists have "uncovered the ancient wall confirming its long-standing significance."   
   
    ◦ [Jacob's Well](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3r24B4eL3u19t8iF7)   
   
• Capernaum (Kefar Nahum), Galilee, Israel: Described as Jesus' new base after leaving Nazareth. Historians have "uncovered the ruins of this town" where "you can stand in the basalt foundations of the first-century synagogue where Jesus taught." Less than 100 meters away, "you can see the remains of a house which was believed to be Peter's and later this house was turned into a church." Ancient graffiti has even been found scratched into the walls.

• Pool of Bethesda, Jerusalem: This site near the sheep gates was mocked by skeptics for centuries, but in the 19th century, archaeologists uncovered it exactly as described, with "two pools with five covered walkways." Jesus healed a man here who had been unwell for 38 years.   
   
    ◦ [Pool of Bethesda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qc2jGvJvE37G9tK86)   
   
• Bethsaida (et-Tell or El-Araj), Sea of Galilee, Israel: The ruins of Bethsaida "still show fishing gear houses in the city gate," grounding the story of Jesus feeding 5,000 men with five loaves and two fish.   
   
    ◦ [Bethsaida (et-Tell archaeological site)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p2b1Y93oB435Hh41A) (This is one of the main candidate sites)   
   
• Tyre (Sour), Lebanon: Mentioned as a "pagan Phoenician port where excavations reveal massive stone temples still echoing the past." Here, Jesus met the Syro-Phoenician woman.   
   
    ◦ [Tyre Necropolis (archaeological site)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k3xH4n6Y3H11uH4j7)   
   
• Caesarea Philippi (Banias), Israel: Described as a "pagan stronghold with shrines to Pan and a cave nicknamed the gates of Hades," which "is still visible today." It was here that Jesus asked his disciples, "Who do you say I am?"

• Tomb of Lazarus, Al-Eizariya, West Bank: The source states that if you visit Israel, "you can also visit the supposed tomb of Lazarus in modern-day Bethany," and that "many other burial caves from that time have also been found."   
   
    ◦ [Tomb of Lazarus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7tG1k3Y5p7F8g31n8)   
   
• Royal Stoa (Southern Wall Excavations), Temple Mount, Jerusalem: When Jesus drove out the money changers from the temple a second time and began teaching, the source points to the "remains of the royal stoa, a covered portico which precisely matches Josephus's descriptions where teaching would often happen."   
   
    ◦ [Southern Wall Archaeological Park (Ophel Archaeological Garden, where the Royal Stoa was located)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/64h2tC7132Q92u9s7)   
   
• Garden of Gethsemane, Mount of Olives, Jerusalem: This "olive grove" at the foot of the Mount of Olives is a "familiar resting place for pilgrims." A recent study found that olive trees growing there today are over 900 years old, "not the originals but likely they sprouted from the ancient roots."   
   
    ◦ [Garden of Gethsemane](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9Qh51n6g5NqR949W8)   
   
• Herod's Palace / Roman Praetorium (Citadel/Tower of David area), Jerusalem: Most scholars believe Pilate's Roman Praetorium was at Herod's Palace near the Jaffa Gate, "where excavations have uncovered a Roman-era courtyard and a judgment seat."   
   
    ◦ [Tower of David Museum (site of Herod's Palace)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t6Hn6Qv4sK9QhCgB8)   
   
• Sisters of Zion Convent (Lithostrotos/Gabbatha), Jerusalem: Tradition also points to a stone pavement beneath the Sisters of Zion convent at Gabbatha as a possible location for Pilate's judgment seat, though it might be "slightly later in time."   
   
    ◦ [Lithostrotos - Convent of the Sisters of Zion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d3KjL2k6UqP5M4KGA)   
   
• Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem: This site is presented as the "strongest historical candidate" for the real Golgotha (place of the skull) and Jesus' tomb. Archaeology confirms that "first-century tombs near the holy sepulchre match this style with locally burial niches and round stones that are put in front of the entrance."   
   
    ◦ [Church of the Holy Sepulchre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hG5k93pQYd2mC3sGA)   
   
• Garden Tomb, Jerusalem: Mentioned as an "alternative site" for Golgotha and Jesus' tomb. Its style "likely dates back to the first century according to some archaeologists."   
   
    ◦ [The Garden Tomb](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S41uU5r6oYc23gWk9)   
   
• Mount of Olives (Ascension site), Jerusalem: The source notes that "archaeology confirms this location near Jerusalem and Christians have honored this site since the earliest days" as the place of Jesus' ascension into heaven.
