title: A rich visualization of quantum superposition showing a part...

A rich visualization of quantum superposition showing a particle existing in multiple states simultaneously. The central probability cloud contains quantum states |0⟩ and |1⟩, with connecting paths showing how measurement collapses the superposition into a single state. Schrödinger's cat appears simultaneously alive and dead until observed.   
"Until observed, reality exists as a spectrum of possibilities rather than certainties."
