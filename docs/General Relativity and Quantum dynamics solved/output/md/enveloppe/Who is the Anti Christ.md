It's a layer for this Yeah   
   
## America and the Second Beast of Revelation   
   
Just hours before George W. Bush beat John Kerry on November 2 of 2004, an [Associated Press article](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) declared the following:   
   
Statements such as “_A day that will decide the fate of the world_” and “_The planet’s destiny is decided in large part by America_” are not minor sentences. What happens in Washington DC affects the entire globe. In this light we inquire: Is America mentioned in Bible prophecy, or has God’s Word overlooked the world’s only superpower?   
   
Many prophecy writers emphatically state that we are not there. They see the US fading into oblivion under a supposedly future New World Order dominated by the United Nations. In this document I want to give you something different to think about. I want to strongly suggest the possibility that America is the exact power specifically mentioned in this following mysterious verse: [Revelation 13:11](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)   
   
Allow me to build a case. First, what is a “beast”? Answer: A great nation. The proofs are found in Daniel 7, a chapter that clearly parallels Revelation 13. Chapters talk about beasts, ten horns, a mouth speaking great things, and war on the saints (see Daniel 7:3-8, 21 and Revelation 13:1-7).   
   
Daniel 7 describes four beasts: the lion, bear, leopard and dragon like beast. An angelic interpreter confirmed the answer to the symbolic meaning of a beast:   
   
Daniel 7:23 “_The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth._”   
   
According to Scripture, a beast is NOT a computer or some evil person, but a kingdom. Note this is what the angel said and is not my interpretation. Historically, 98% of Christian scholars have interpreted Daniel’s four beasts to represent the ancient nations of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. Now back to the beast from the _earth_:   
   
Revelation 13:11 “_I saw another beast coming out of the earth._”   
   
Thus John saw a great nation rising. From where? “_Out of the earth._” Daniel’s beasts all rose from the sea (see Daniel 7:3-7). Water in prophecy represents multitudes of people. The answer is again confirmed by another angelic interpreter:   
   
Revelation 17:15 “_The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and tongues._”   
   
Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome all rose from the midst of a sea of peoples in Europe and the Middle East. Not so with the beast in [Revelation 13:11](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) as it comes from the earth. This points to a great nation rising out of a sparsely inhabited area.   
   
Revelation 13:11 “_I saw another beast coming out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb._”   
   
Each word is very significant. The true Lamb of course is Jesus Christ. “_Like a lamb,_” indicates this nation would have lamb like or Christian features. A lamb is a young animal, a baby sheep. Thus this nation would at one time be youthful and new. Significantly, its “_two horns_” have no crowns like the first beast in [Revelation 13:2](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1). Crowns represent kingly power. Thus we have a new nation, with Christian features, rising out of a sparsely inhabited area, with a government without kingly power. We also know what time this occurred. You will note that this second beast of Revelation that comes out of the earth rises after the first beast of Revelation receives the deadly head wound which occurred in 1798.   
   
Revelation 13:3, 12 “_And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast… 12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed._”   
   
The Papal Church rose to power in 538 A.D. The Bible informs us they would have un-interrupted power for 1260 dark years which brings us to 1798. Precisely on time as prophesied, in 1798 Napoleon sent his General Berthier down to Rome to kidnap the Pope and exiled and imprisoned him in France. In 1799 the Pope became ill and died. This was the deadly head wound. For a little while there was no head of the Roman Catholic Church. The Encyclopedia Americana, 1941 edition says:   
   
![Comment](https://www.the-antichrist.org/images/comment.gif)“_In 1798 he (Berthier) made his entrance into Rome, ABOLISHED THE PAPAL GOVERNMENT and established a secular one._”   
   
So what nation was starting out in the late 1700’s? Are the pieces starting to come together yet?   
   
Revelation 12 also reveals information as to the identity of the second beast. Remember that this passage is symbolic and that a Church is represented as woman frequently in the Bible as the Church is the bride of Christ. The period of time described in this passage is the same 1260 dark Papal years of persecution where God’s true Church had to flea into the wilderness to survive. See also chapter 11 on [Revelation Bible Study](http://www.revelationbibleprophecy.org/revelation11.html) for more regarding this time period. A time is 1 year, times is 2 years and half a time is .5 of a year. This totals 3.5 years, which is 42 months and of course is the same period of time as the first beast of Revelation 13 being the same power. See also “**Until a time and times and the dividing of time**” previously from Adam Clarke's Commentary on [Daniel 7:25](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1).   
   
Revelation 13:5-7 “_And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue **forty and two months**. 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 7 And it was given unto him to **make war with the saints**, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations._”   
   
So Revelation 12 reveals Satan pursuing God’s true Church, through the Papacy, into the wilderness for 1260 dark years to avoid the murderous persecution of the Papal Church, but the “_earth_” (referring to the beast from the earth) opens up a refuge for those fleeing the persecution. Thus what we have is a nation that greatly began with people that were fleeing from the Papal persecution. What nation did these Protestants flea to and make a declaration that Church and state should never again be combined?   
   
Revelation 12:14-16 “_And to the woman [Church] were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a **time, and times, and half a time**, [42 months] from the face of the serpent. [Satan] 15 And the serpent [Satan] cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman [Church], that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood [persecution]. 16 And the **earth** [unpopulated area] helped the **woman** [Church], and the earth opened her mouth, [a nation provided a place of refuge for those fleeing persecution] and swallowed up the flood [persecution] which the dragon [Satan] cast out of his mouth_.” Parenthesis added.   
   
Revelation 13 also reveals that this exact nation will finally achieve superpower status during the last moments of time, make a major mistake, and lead out in the global enforcement of [666 and the mark of the beast](http://www.666mark-of-the-beast.org/). See also the [what is mark of the beast](http://www.markbeast.org/) or [666 and the number of the beast](http://www.666numberofthebeast.com/) for the origins of the number 666. God’s Word reports:   
   
Revelation 13:16-17 “_And he [the lamb-like beast] causes [he resorts to force] all [his power becomes global], both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead, that no man might buy or sell [the world’s economy is involved] except the one who has the mark._”   
   
And finally the above two verses parallel the last part of [Revelation 13:11](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) describing the final, tragic act of the lamb like beast, “_he spoke like a dragon._”   
   
Now let's recap Revelation 13 revealing the identity of both the first and the second beast.   
   
**Revelation 13:1-10** These six points reveal that the Antichrist leopard like beast represents the Roman Church:   
   
**1.** [Revelation 13:1](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)—Antichrist rises from the _sea_ (from a _populated_ area. [Revelation 17:15](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)).     
**2.** [Revelation 13:2](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)—Antichrist receives the SEAT of its government from pagan Rome.     
**3.** [Revelation 13:5](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)—Antichrist blasphemously claims the POWER of God (Luke 5:20-21).     
**4.** [Revelation 13:7](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)—Antichrist PERSECUTES the saints (believers).     
**5.** [Revelation 13:5](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)—Antichrist reigns supreme for 42 months = 1,260 prophetic days or 1260 literal years (from 538 to 1798).     
**6.** [Revelation 13:18](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)—Antichrist is identified with the mysterious number 666.   
   
[**Revelation 13:10**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The _second_ beast arises at the SAME TIME the _first_ beast goes into captivity, or around 1798. It is a separate power.   
   
[**Revelation 13:11**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The _second_ beast rises rapidly from an UNPOPULATED area, “_the earth._”   
   
[**Revelation 13:11**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The _second_ beast has two horns with NO CROWNS. It has no king. It is not an autocratic dictatorship but a DEMOCRACY, saying to the _people_ that “they” should make an image to the first beast. (Revelation 13:14)   
   
[**Revelation 13:11**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The _second_ beast is a young beast, a youthful power, full of freedom and innocence, a NEW nation. (Remember a beast represents a nation (kingdom). [Daniel 7:17](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1); [7:23](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)) In this prophecy:   
   
**1.** A NEW nation arises     
**2**. Around 1798     
**3**. In an UNPOPULATED area     
**4**. Without kingly authority     
**5**. Governed by the people. It has the lamb like quality of Jesus, allowing its people freedom of choice.     
**6**. The ONLY nation that fits ALL these prophetic specifications is the UNITED STATES.   
   
[**Revelation 13:11-12**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The features of the lamb-like beast rapidly turn into a DRAGON. _Religious liberty_ is followed by _religious oppression_.   
   
[**Revelation 13:12**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The _second_ beast, the UNITED STATES, gives its influence to the _first_ beast, the Papacy, and becomes the _enforcer nation_ with a UNION of Church and state.   
   
[**Revelation 13:12**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) The central issue in the final conflict is “WORSHIP.” (See [Revelation 14:7-12](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)) The Sabbath is God’s eternal SIGN of true worship of Him as CREATOR.   
   
[**Revelation 13:13-14**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) Satan will use MIRACULOUS SIGNS and WONDERS at a time of international crisis to forge a UNION of Church and state which will violently oppose and oppress God’s people. (See Revelation 16:14 and 2 Thessalonians 2:9)   
   
[**Revelation 12:17**](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) God’s faithful people will not yield to the coercive pressure to violate God’s law.   
   
So examine all the relevant pieces of information again in brief:   
   
**1)** [Revelation 13:11](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1) predicts the rising of a great beast     
**2)** In prophecy, a beast represents a great nation     
**3)** This nation comes out of the earth, or wilderness area     
**4)** This nation starts out young, like a baby lamb     
**5)** This nation is lamb like, with Christian characteristics     
**6)** This nation grows to power when the first beast receives a deadly wound     
**7)** This nation becomes a refuge for many Protestants fleeing Papal persecution     
**8)** This nation has horns with no crowns, it has no kings     
**9)** This nation achieves superpower status near the end of time     
**10)** This nation influences the world’s economy     
**11)** This nation finally speaks like a dragon     
**12)** This nation finally enforces the mark of the first beast in [Revelation 13:2](https://www.the-antichrist.org/#1)   
   
Now how many nations on Planet Earth fit each of these clear, unquestionable, Heaven inspired details?   
   
![American President bows before the Pope](https://www.the-antichrist.org/images/presidentpope.jpg)There is only one.   
   
The United States of America!   
   
Do we ever see any evidence that America and the Papal Church are close? Did an American President once bow down before a dead Pope? This is a very distressing topic and not one I am prepared to go into, but an internet search on secret societies, freemasonry and Jesuits reveals some shocking information. You may also like to watch some free online material on secret societies and other related topics. Here is a link to [page three](http://amazingdiscoveries.tv/search/Total_Onslaught/&p=2) from the series Total Onslaught that you may like to start with. For more on this topic you will find one called Two Beasts Become Friends.   
   
God has very much blessed America. Yet Bible prophecy predicts major changes will someday envelop the beloved country of America and our eyes should be wide open to even now discern the proverbial writing on the wall. May the Lord Jesus Christ prepare you for future events. Above all, may we each have a strong relationship with the true Lamb, Jesus Christ our Lord and reject the voice of the dragon.   
   
## The False Prophet   
   
Many Christians today are also asking who is the _False Prophet_ described in the book of Revelation. It is in fact the same power or what is also known as _Apostate Protestantism_ or the _second beast_ of Revelation 13 in the role of America in making an image to the beast etc.   
   
We are not going to go into major detail here but here are some scriptures that make this apparent. Parentheses are added for clarity.   
   
Revelation 13:11-15 “_And I beheld another [SECOND] beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon. 12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the [FIRST] beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the [FIRST] beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. 15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the [FIRST] beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the [FIRST] beast should be killed._”   
   
Note in the above passage that the second beast is said to perform “_great wonders_” that deceives “_by the means of the miracles_” that it did “_in the sight of the [first] beast._” Now take note in the scripture below that the false prophet that _deceived_ them by her _miracles_ as described in the above verse, being the second beast (America), is the same entity. So the false prophet is the second beast that did “_miracles before him_” or in other words, did miracles “_in the sight of the [first] beast_” as described in the passage above.   
   
Revelation 19:20 “_And the [FIRST] beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone._”   
   
There is much more that verifies the false prophet is the United States of America and apostate Protestantism but these verses are more than adequate proof. Please read this verse by verse Bible commentary on [Revelation Bible Prophecy](http://www.revelationbibleprophecy.org/) for more information.
