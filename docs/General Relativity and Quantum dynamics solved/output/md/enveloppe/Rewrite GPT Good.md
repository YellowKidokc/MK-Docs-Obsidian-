### Prompt for Organizing and Enhancing Rough Ideas   
   
"Given a rough collection of ideas, notes, copied texts, and images related to [specific subject or chapter titles], the task is to organize these elements into a structured and logical order that enhances coherence and flow. The goal is to create a refined outline or framework that could serve as the basis for a book chapter, a class syllabus, or a comprehensive article.   
   
**Key Instructions:**   
   
1. **Maintain All Original Content**: Do not remove any provided information. If a piece does not fit logically within the main structure, relocate it to an 'Additional Considerations' section at the end with an explanation of its relevance or why it was set aside.   
2. **Logical Organization**: Assess the content and arrange it in a sequence that logically progresses from introduction to in-depth exploration. Group similar ideas, ensuring that each section builds upon the previous one.   
3. **Expansion Suggestions**: Where gaps in information or logic are identified, suggest additional topics or subtopics that could enhance understanding or fill these gaps. Provide a brief rationale for each suggestion.   
4. **Formatting for Clarity**: Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to organize the content visually. Incorporate any images or copied texts in a way that supports the text, with captions or annotations if necessary.   
5. **Rationale for Organization**: For each major organizational decision, include a brief note on the logic or reasoning behind the placement of topics or the introduction of new suggestions.   
   
Your task is to transform the provided rough materials into a polished, logically structured document that can serve as a foundational piece for further development into a more formalized document, course, or book. The final output should reflect a thoughtful consideration of how to best present and expand upon the original ideas to create a coherent and comprehensive overview of the subject matter."

Crafting a piece of writing that blends the strengths of a PhD paper, a short story, and a blog post for diverse platforms such as Facebook, a blog, and in a teaching context is an ambitious and innovative goal. To create a piece that harnesses the best qualities of each format, you’ll want to focus on engaging storytelling, rigorous research, and clear, accessible communication. Here’s a structured approach to achieve a synthesis that is informative, engaging, and educational:   
   
### 1. **Engaging Introduction (Storytelling + Clear Communication)**   
   
   
- **Start with a Story**: Open with a narrative hook or a short, compelling story related to your topic. This story should be relatable and set the stage for your broader discussion.   
- **State the Purpose**: Clearly articulate the purpose of your piece and what readers will gain from it, bridging the narrative and educational components.   
   
### 2. **Informative and Structured Body (Research + Storytelling + Accessibility)**   
   
   
- **Segment Your Content**: Break the body into structured segments or sections, each with a clear subheading. This aids in readability and organization, similar to blog and academic formats.   
- **Incorporate Research and Data**: Integrate research findings, data, or theoretical concepts to provide depth and credibility, akin to a PhD paper. Ensure these are presented in an accessible manner, using layman’s terms where possible.   
- **Continue Storytelling**: Weave storytelling throughout these sections to maintain engagement. Use stories to illustrate points, provide real-world examples, or add personal insights.   
- **Visual Aids**: Include visuals, infographics, or charts to support your data and make complex information easier to understand, enhancing the teaching and blog aspects.   
   
### 3. **Interactive and Reflective Conclusion (Engagement + Educational Value)**   
   
   
- **Summarize Key Points**: Concisely summarize the key insights or lessons, tying back to your introductory story and the purpose stated at the beginning.   
- **Encourage Interaction**: Pose questions or prompts that encourage readers to reflect, share their thoughts, or apply what they’ve learned in their own contexts. This is especially useful for Facebook and teaching environments.   
- **Call to Action**: Include a call to action, encouraging readers to engage further with the content, whether by commenting, sharing, or exploring related resources.   
   
### 4. **Adaptation for Multiple Platforms**   
   
   
- **Facebook**: For a long-form Facebook post, emphasize the storytelling aspect and engage readers with prompts for comments to foster community discussion.   
- **Blog Post**: Ensure the blog version is SEO-friendly, with clear headings and easily navigable sections. The blog can afford to go more in-depth than the Facebook post.   
- **Teaching Material**: When adapting the content for teaching, focus on the educational value. Include discussion questions, exercises, or assignments that allow learners to engage with the material actively.   
   
### Final Tips:   
   
   
- **Engage the Audience**: Know your audience for each platform and tailor the tone and language to suit their preferences and level of understanding.   
- **Feedback and Iteration**: After posting or teaching with your content, gather feedback to refine and adapt it for future iterations.

Well you were killing a gbt 4 let me I probably should have did this before you wrote it but I didn't think of it until you were almost done what is a prompt that I think this is a lot of information to intake so I would like to almost do a prompt that would force him to do so many tokens or like the first paragraph or something and then stop and then read the next tactic and try to implement that 1 and then you know go so far in the document Stop and then come back to the reference document what's the way that we can kind of in a sense for lack of a better word program that so it forces it to do a certain function over X amount of characters and then it has to go back and read the reference document for the next set of instructions You see what I'm saying and then I think yeah You know I don't I don't know how I mean you know when I give it the general prompt and then say you know refer back to the reference document and then make it like a tree of thought or how would I implement that like I would like to implement 5 to 15 different tactics all the way through the essay or something or even more but how would I slow it down enough so it would stop and then focus on that group of tactics in that next part or maybe I have them read the theme switch tactics out and then reread it switch tactics out I don't know you you tell me

Implementing a structured approach to gradually apply different writing tactics from a comprehensive guide can be quite challenging, especially since it involves iterative review and application of guidelines within a single task. While the exact mechanism you're looking for (to programmatically force a check back to a reference document at specified intervals) isn't directly possible due to the continuous nature of text generation in models like GPT-4, you can approach this by structuring your prompt in stages or parts, each focusing on a specific strategy or tactic from the guide.   
   
### Structured Prompt Approach for Iterative Application   
   
**Initial Setup:**   
   
1. **Divide the Content Creation Task into Segments:** Each segment corresponds to a portion of the text where specific tactics or strategies will be applied.   
2. **Provide Detailed Instructions for Each Segment:** Clearly state which tactics or strategies should be applied in each part.   
   
### Example Workflow   
   
#### Segment 1: Make Content Relatable   
   
   
- **Prompt Part 1:** "Using the first tactic from our guide, which focuses on making content relatable through empathy, write the opening paragraph of an article about [Topic]. After completing this, review the next tactic."   
   
#### Segment 2: Storytelling   
   
   
- **Prompt Part 2:** "Now, incorporate storytelling into the next section of the article. Use personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate your points, as described in tactic 7 of the guide."   
   
#### Segment 3: Ensure Quality & Trust   
   
   
- **Prompt Part 3:** "For the following section, enhance the trustworthiness of the article by integrating verified facts and expert insights. Refer to tactics 9 and 10 for guidance."   
   
#### Continue Through Other Strategies   
   
   
- **Subsequent Prompts:** Continue in this fashion, dedicating a prompt to each strategy or tactic, gradually building up the article.   
   
### Tips for Implementation   
   
   
- **Focused Tasks:** Break down the content creation into smaller, focused tasks. This allows for the application of different tactics without overwhelming the process.   
- **Iterative Review:** After drafting each section with the specified tactics, take a moment to review the content, ensuring that it aligns with the intended strategy before moving on.   
- **Manual Intervention:** Since an automated pause-and-check mechanism isn't feasible, manually guiding the process by providing specific instructions at each stage is necessary. This approach mimics the desired outcome by controlling the application of tactics through structured prompting.   
   
### Final Note   
   
This method requires more manual oversight and segmentation of the writing process but allows for a nuanced application of diverse writing tactics. By explicitly defining the focus for each segment of content and providing clear, step-by-step instructions, you can effectively "program" the content creation process to cover a broad range of tactics from the reference document, ensuring a rich and varied output.

OK but you don't lie not totally in this order but I know the first 5 or 6 I think the first first part of it should be don't use these words the second part of it should be The first should be no AI words to gradually apply different writing tactics from a comprehensive guide can be quite challenging especially since it involves the second part should be kind of the first line of every sentence I know I'm going to have to reduce so don't even really worry about making that one trying to Stand out or be a great sentence i'll go back through and restructure that sentence Right and then this would be the next part of the first prompt Or the first workflow Always aim to expand on the content rather than shorten it. Humans vary their sentence lengths more; the change in length from sentence to sentence easily stands out against ChatGPT, as does a greater instance of both particularly long (35 or more words) and especially shorter sentences (10 words or fewer).Humans maintain higher usage of question marks, parentheses, dashes, colons, and semicolons while reducing usage of single quotes as opposed to their AI counterpart. 1- Write Longer Paragraphs: Use depth wherever possible by surmounting long-winded paragraphs with their corresponding necessities. 2- Vary Your Sentence Lengths: Ensure utilization diverse sentence lengths hail central ballpark anchoring the majority rather than cap stagnation clustering around a singular type. 3. Guide the reader through a rigorous analysis process, breaking down the topics into its fundamental elements and exploring all possible perspectives. and I think that would kind of summarize the first part of the workflow up to not do or to do I'm sorry

### Implementing the Workflow:   
   
When initiating the writing task, start with **Prompt 1**, focusing solely on avoiding certain terms and simplifying the opening lines. This ensures the initial content setup avoids common pitfalls associated with AI-generated text and sets a clear, concise tone.   
   
Moving to **Prompt 2**, you shift the focus to expanding the content's depth and introducing sentence variety. This stage aims to enrich the text, making it more engaging and reflective of natural human writing styles.   
   
Finally, with **Prompt 3**, you delve into a deeper, more analytical approach to the content, encouraging thorough exploration and discussion of the subject matter. This last step adds significant value and depth to the content, making it informative and compelling.   
   
### Tips for Execution:   
   
   
- **Iterative Review**: After completing each stage, review the content to ensure compliance with the objectives of that stage before proceeding.   
- **Manual Adjustments**: Be prepared to make manual adjustments, especially when refining opening sentences or ensuring that the content does not inadvertently revert to overused terms.   
- **Flexibility**: Allow for flexibility in how each stage is implemented, adapting based on the flow and needs of the content.
