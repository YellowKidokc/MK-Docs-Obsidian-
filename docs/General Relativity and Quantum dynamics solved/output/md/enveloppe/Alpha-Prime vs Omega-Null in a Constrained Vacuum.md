# DP-00: Alpha-Prime vs Omega-Null in a Constrained Vacuum   
   
## Simulation Setup   
   
- **Environment:** Absolute void, no preloaded structure.     
- **Entities:**     
  - [Alpha-Prime (α)](Alpha-Prime%20(%CE%B1).md): instantiated as pure coherent potential. Constraint = no creative capacity (`K_α = 0`).     
  - [Omega-Null (Ω)](Omega-Null%20(%CE%A9).md): instantiated as parasitic force of dissolution, fully active (`K_Ω >> 0`).     
- **Central Question:** If Good is reduced to passive coherence, can it survive against active Evil?     
   
> *Mia (scribbling in the logbook):* “So α is basically handcuffed. Pure potential but no way to act.”     
> *Kai:* “Exactly. I want to see if Good has any defensive baseline, or if it only matters when it can create.”     
> *Mia:* “Feels like a test of ‘faith without works’ — what happens if the principle of Good just sits there.”

## Simulation Loops   
   
**Loop 1 – Initial State**     
   
- α sits as a stable but inert potential field.     
- Ω instantly detects coherence and moves toward it.     
   
> *Mia:* “That didn’t take long. Ω smells order like a shark smells blood.”     
   
**Loop 2 – Parasitic Engagement**     
   
- Ω injects logical noise, paradoxes, and entropic fluctuations.     
- α, unable to generate counter-order, begins to destabilize internally.     
   
> *Kai:* “This is the essence of [Logical Entropy of Malice (LEM)](Logical%20Entropy%20of%20Malice%20(LEM).md). It doesn’t attack head-on — it unravels things from the inside.”     
> *Mia:* “And since α can’t act, it’s basically a punching bag. No projection, no repair.”     
   
**Loop 3 – Consumption**     
   
- Ω accelerates its rate of dissolution as α’s coherence weakens.     
- Entropy gains efficiency from the very order it destroys.     
   
**Loop 4 – Collapse**     
   
- α’s structure fully degrades, coherence → ∅.     
- Ω prevails, leaving behind only inert potential.

## Core Equations   
   
1. **Energy of α (constrained):**     
E_α = K_α * C_α

Edit   
Since `K_α = 0`, → `E_α = 0`.     
*Interpretation:* Good without action has no energy to sustain itself.     
   
2. **Energy of Ω (active):**     
E_Ω = K_Ω * D_Ω   
   
markdown   
Copy   
Edit   
With Ω fully active, `E_Ω >> 0`.     
*Interpretation:* Evil retains destructive power independent of α’s activity.     
   
3. **Outcome Function:**     
O = (E_Ω - E_α) / t

Copy   
Edit   
With `E_α = 0`, → `O = E_Ω / t`.     
*Interpretation:* The rate of Ω’s dominance is proportional to its own energy output; α contributes nothing.

## Observations   
   
   
- Passive Good is inherently unstable — coherence becomes fuel for entropy.     
- Evil wins *not by creating*, but by parasitizing what already exists.     
- This validates [LEM](LEM.md): Malice feeds on coherence, but cannot sustain itself without prey.     
   
> *Mia:* “So Ω can only ‘win’ if α just lies there. That’s not power, that’s scavenging.”     
> *Kai:* “Yeah. This proves something profound: Good has to *move*. Potential alone isn’t enough.”

## Reflections & Implications   
   
   
- [Axiom of Sustainable Good (ASG)](Axiom%20of%20Sustainable%20Good%20(ASG).md) requires activity: Good must **act, generate, or create** to persist.     
- This parallels the principle that “faith without works is dead” — inert Good collapses into entropy.     
- Ω’s victory here is conditional, not absolute: it only wins in a vacuum where α is silenced.     
   
**Takeaway:**     
The first simulation establishes the asymmetry: **Evil can parasitize, but not create. Good, when constrained, is consumed — but when free to act, it possesses the only sustainable pathway.**
