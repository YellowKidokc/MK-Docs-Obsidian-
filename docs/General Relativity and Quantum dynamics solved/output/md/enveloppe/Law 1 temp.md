Before light. Before atoms. Before orbit or order — there was pull.     
The downward insistence written into spacetime.     
The invisible architect of stars, tides, and temptation.   
   
This is Gravity.     
This is Sin.     
And neither asks your permission to pull you closer.   
   
What does it take to rise?   
   
Welcome to Law 1.

_(Key Takeaways)_   
   
✔️ Physical Gravity: Universal force pulling mass together → Spiritual Parallel: Sin's universal pull towards separation/decay. ✔️ Gravity Strength: Increases with Mass & Proximity → Spiritual Parallel: Sin's pull feels stronger with deeper entanglement & closeness to temptation. ✔️ Escape Velocity: Requires immense external power → Spiritual Parallel: Freedom from Sin requires Divine Grace, not just willpower. ✔️ Spacetime Curvature: Gravity bends reality's fabric → Spiritual Parallel: Sin/Deception can distort our perception of spiritual reality. ✔️ Constant Pull: Gravity always acts → Spiritual Parallel: The tendency towards spiritual entropy/drift is constant.   
   
### Key Questions for Reflection   
   
   
- Where do you feel the "downward pull" most strongly in your life?   
- What external "forces" (Grace, community, practices) are helping you resist it?   
- How does recognizing this as a universal dynamic change your perspective on your struggles?
