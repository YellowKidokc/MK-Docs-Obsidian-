## Connections to Other Laws   
   
- Law 2 (Strong Nuclear Force & Divine Unity): While gravity pulls things apart, the strong force binds them together   
- Law 4 (Entropy & Spiritual Corruption): Both gravity and entropy represent natural tendency toward lower energy states   
- Law 8 (Quantum Uncertainty & Free Will): Our choices exist in probability fields that collapse through conscious decisions   
   
## Development Status   
This law forms the foundation of the entire framework and is currently in advanced development. The core concepts and mathematical models are established, with ongoing work on practical applications and integration with the Master Equation.
