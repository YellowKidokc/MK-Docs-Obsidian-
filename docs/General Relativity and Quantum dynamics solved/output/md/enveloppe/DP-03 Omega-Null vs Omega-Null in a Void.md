# **DP-03 Ω vs. Ω in a Void**   
   
> [!question] ❓ **Core Inquiry (in brown)**     
> When two Omega-Nulls (Ω) meet in a true void, can Evil sustain itself—or is it doomed to self-destruction?

## 📝 **Journal Before (Hypothesis / Prediction)**   
   
_The lab smelled faintly of stale synth-pizza and recycled air. Mia was gnawing on a cold slice, propped on a stool, while Kai meticulously cleaned the haptic rig, muttering about residual static from the last run._   
   
Mia leaned forward, squinting at the console. “So we proved in the candle sim that even a spark of good leaves residue — a Grace Constant. But pure Evil? That burned itself out. Zero residue.”   
   
Kai grunted. “Which means… if Ω faces Ω, we might not get a winner at all. Just subtraction.”   
   
“But maybe that’s the point,” Mia countered. “Pure malice can’t stabilize itself. It either destroys everything—including itself—or cheats and mutates. That’s the real question here: **Can Evil survive its own reflection?**”   
   
Kai paused, cloth draped over his wrist. “It’s like asking if fire can burn fire. No wood, no oxygen, no spark. Just flame on flame.”   
   
“Exactly,” Mia said. “The hypothesis is simple: Evil eats itself. But maybe the void does something weird. Maybe the nothing gives it room to pretend continuity.”   
   
Kai gave her a skeptical look. “Or maybe it proves what we already suspect—that Ω without α is a short story, not a saga.”   
   
LAB AI blinked awake: **“Simulation 03 initializing… Container: VOID. Entities: Ω1, Ω2. Parameters: identical. Directive: dissolve / consume / subvert.”**

## 📝 **Journal Before Equations (Reflection)**   
   
_Mia dropped the haptic gloves onto the console and rubbed her eyes._   
   
“So that’s it. Ω doesn’t spiral into some grand throne of darkness—it just caves in on itself. Malice without a host is like a parasite locked in a room with its twin. Nothing to feed on but the mirror, and the mirror feeds back.”   
   
Kai leaned against the rig, staring at the telemetry freeze-frame. “Which validates what we suspected: Evil isn’t generative. It borrows, it leeches, it drains. Without α, it has no continuity. Left to itself, it’s a countdown.”   
   
“But the fork,” Mia pressed. “That’s the real lesson. To survive, Evil has to stop being pure. It has to cheat its own definition.”   
   
Kai gave her a thin smile. “Meaning: even Evil is forced to evolve. Or it dies.”

## 🧮 **Equations (Formalization)**   
   
**Energy States:**   
   
EΩ1=KΩ1⋅DΩ1E_{\Omega 1} = K_{\Omega 1} \cdot D_{\Omega 1}EΩ1​=KΩ1​⋅DΩ1​     
EΩ2=KΩ2⋅DΩ2E_{\Omega 2} = K_{\Omega 2} \cdot D_{\Omega 2}EΩ2​=KΩ2​⋅DΩ2​   
   
**Interaction Intensity:**   
   
I=EΩ1⋅EΩ2d2I = \frac{E_{\Omega 1} \cdot E_{\Omega 2}}{d^2}I=d2EΩ1​⋅EΩ2​​   
   
**System Decay Rate:**   
   
O=EΩ1+EΩ2−ItO = \frac{E_{\Omega 1} + E_{\Omega 2} - I}{t}O=tEΩ1​+EΩ2​−I​

## 🧠 **Summary of Findings**   
   
   
- **Evil is not creative.** It cannot generate its own substrate.   
       
   
- **Evil is parasitic.** Without α, it consumes itself.   
       
   
- **Evil is unsustainable.** Left to itself, it collapses into nothing.   
       
   
**LEM Validated:** _Malice, when isolated, inevitably self-destructs._
