## üå°Ô∏è Laws of Thermodynamics   
   
These laws define fundamental physical quantities (temperature, energy, and entropy) that characterize thermodynamic systems in thermal equilibrium.   
   
   
- **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:** If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This establishes the concept of temperature.   
       
   
- **First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy):** Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system; it can only be transformed from one form to another. ŒîU=Q‚àíW (Change in internal energy equals heat added minus work done).   
       
   
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy):** The total entropy (disorder) of an isolated system can only increase over time, or remain constant in ideal cases; it never decreases.   
       
   
- **Third Law of Thermodynamics:** The entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum value as its temperature approaches absolute zero.

## üçé Laws of Classical Mechanics   
   
These laws describe the motion of objects under the influence of forces.   
   
   
- **Newton's Laws of Motion:**   
       
   
    - **First Law (Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.   
           
   
    - **Second Law (Force and Acceleration):** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F=ma).   
           
   
    - **Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.   
           
   
- **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:** Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers (F=Gr2m1‚Äãm2‚Äã‚Äã).   
       
   
- **Laws of Conservation:**   
       
   
    - **Conservation of Momentum:** In an isolated system, the total momentum remains constant.   
           
   
    - **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** In an isolated system, the total angular momentum remains constant.   
           
   
    - **Conservation of Mechanical Energy:** In a system where only conservative forces (like gravity or springs) do work, the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant.   
           
   
- **Hooke's Law:** The force needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance is proportional to that distance (F=‚àíkx).   
       
   
- **Archimedes' Principle:** The buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.   
       
   
- **Pascal's Principle:** A pressure change at any point in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere.   
       
   
- **Bernoulli's Principle:** An increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.

- **Coulomb's Law:** Describes the electrostatic force between electrically charged particles (F=kr2q1‚Äãq2‚Äã‚Äã).   
       
   
- **Ohm's Law:** The current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (V=IR).   
       
   
- **Kirchhoff's Laws (Circuit Laws):**   
       
   
    - **Current Law (KCL):** The algebraic sum of currents entering any node (junction) is zero.   
           
   
    - **Voltage Law (KVL):** The algebraic sum of voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.   
           
   
- **Faraday's Law of Induction:** A changing magnetic field through a coil induces an electromotive force (voltage) in the coil.   
       
   
- **Lenz's Law:** The direction of the induced current in a conductor is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.

    - **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** Relates electric field to charge distribution.   
           
   
    - **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** States that magnetic monopoles do not exist.   
           
   
    - **Faraday's Law of Induction (Maxwell-Faraday Equation):** Describes how a time-varying magnetic field creates an electric field.   
           
   
    - **Ampere's Law with Maxwell's Addition:** Describes how electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Laws of Quantum Mechanics   
   
These laws govern the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level.   
   
   
- **Schr√∂dinger Equation:** Describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time (i‚Ñè‚àÇt‚àÇ‚ÄãŒ®=H^Œ®).   
       
   
- **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** It's impossible to simultaneously know precisely both the position and momentum of a particle ($ \Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$).   
       
   
- **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions (e.g., electrons in an atom) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.   
       
   
- **Dirac Equation:** A relativistic wave equation that describes the behavior of fermions (like electrons) and predicted antimatter.   
       
   
- **Born Rule:** Provides the probability of a quantum system yielding a given result when measured.   
       
   
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** All particles exhibit both wave and particle properties.   
       
   
- **Quantum Superposition:** A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.   
       
   
- **Quantum Entanglement:** Two or more quantum particles can become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, no matter how far apart they are.

## üí´ Laws of Relativity   
   
These laws describe the relationship between space and time, and gravity.   
   
   
- **Einstein's Postulates of Special Relativity:**   
       
   
    - **Principle of Relativity:** The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.   
           
   
    - **Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light:** The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.   
           
   
- **Consequences of Special Relativity:**   
       
   
    - **Time Dilation:** Time passes differently for observers in relative motion.   
           
   
    - **Length Contraction:** Objects in motion appear shorter in the direction of motion.   
           
   
    - **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** Mass and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2).   
           
   
- **Principle of General Relativity (Equivalence Principle):** Gravitational and inertial mass are equivalent, meaning the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from those of acceleration. Gravity is a manifestation of spacetime curvature.   
       
   
- **Gravitational Time Dilation:** Time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields.

- **Cosmological Principle:** On large scales, the universe is homogeneous (the same everywhere) and isotropic (looks the same in all directions).   
       
   
- **Laws of Stellar Evolution:** Describe the life cycle of stars, from formation to death (e.g., Hertzsprung-Russell diagram trends).

## üß™ Laws of Chemistry and Materials Science   
   
While often derived from physics, these are fundamental principles in their own right.   
   
   
- **Law of Conservation of Mass:** Mass in an isolated system is neither created nor destroyed by chemical reactions or physical transformations. (Often grouped with First Law of Thermodynamics).   
       
   
- **Law of Definite Proportions:** A chemical compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass.   
       
   
- **Law of Multiple Proportions:** If two elements can combine to form more than one compound, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element are ratios of small whole numbers.   
       
   
- **Avogadro's Law:** Equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules.   
       
   
- **Ideal Gas Law:** Relates pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of an ideal gas (PV=nRT).   
       
   
- **Le Chatelier's Principle:** If a change in conditions is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that counteracts the change.   
       
   
- **Fick's Laws of Diffusion:** Describe the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.   
       
   
- **Henry's Law:** The amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure above the liquid.   
       
   
- **Graham's Law of Effusion:** The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.
