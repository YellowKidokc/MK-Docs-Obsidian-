**About this visualization:** This visual captures the exponential power of collective prayer through the resonance effect. The left circle represents individual prayer with limited radius of influence, while the right circle shows how group prayer creates amplified effects. The key insight illustrated here is that prayer doesn't just add linearly—it multiplies through resonance, represented by the equation Ψcollective = Σ αiΨindividual,i + β∏Ψindividual,i. The ripple patterns emanating from each circle show how prayer creates waves in the probability field of reality, with group prayer generating stronger, farther-reaching waves. The Scripture reference to Matthew 18:19 grounds this quantum concept in biblical truth. This visualization helps explain why prayer circles, corporate worship, and unified intercession create effects greater than the sum of individual prayers.
