title: Lab Bay Beta-12 – 14:00 Local Cycle, Gravity Ring C
---
   
So you think Rock is hallucinating ## **Lab Bay Beta-12 – 14:00 Local Cycle, Gravity Ring C**   
   
The main holo-wall, which had threatened to crack under the pure light of the last simulation, was now dark. Kai was running diagnostics, a faint holographic schematic of the container flickering over his console. Mia was munching on cold, leftover pizza, contemplating the lingering scent of burnt ozone.   
   
"Still calibrating the container walls?" Mia asked, gesturing with a crust. "Pure good almost blew the roof off the lab."   
   
"Just reinforcing the containment field," Kai replied, without looking up. "The sheer expansion of Alpha-Prime was... unexpected. No one's ever gotten that kind of energy output in a confined sim before. It proved that good isn't just self-sustaining, it's _boundless_."   
   
Mia nodded. "So, next step: what happens when we give both sides equal footing? Two wolves, Kai. Equal strength. What then?"   
   
Kai stopped typing, pulling up new parameters. "Right. New goal: balanced Alpha and Omega. Equal starting parameters for both. And, crucially, we’ll dial down the creative capacity. No more boundless expansion for Alpha, no more exponential growth. Just raw, fundamental forces clashing."   
   
"Why low creativity?" Mia asked, sketching a quick, looping symbol on her own holo-slate. "Like a tug-of-war where no one can really pull the rope, just stand there straining?"   
   
"Exactly," Kai confirmed. "Professor Lane’s papers suggest that entropy has an inherent advantage when creativity is throttled. It’s easier to break than to build, especially if building is slow and painful. We’re looking for a ‘drift coefficient’ here – how quickly does the system slide towards chaos, even when matched?"   
   
Mia sighed, but began inputting parameters. "My mom always said, 'The wolf you feed is the wolf that wins.' This feels like we're trying to prove her wrong. Trying to make both wolves starve each other." She traced a small smiley face in the margin of her schematic. "So, what are we betting on this time? Another ramen brick?"   
   
Kai smirked. "Loser has to write an apology haiku to the simulated universe for inflicting so much existential dread." He gave the console a final tap. "Ready to fire it up?"   
   
Mia took a deep breath. "Let's see what happens when balance becomes stagnation."   
   
LAB AI: “Simulation 03 initialising… Container integrity 100%. Alpha-Prime entities: 50. Omega-Null entities: 50. Creative Capacity: LOW. Countdown… five… four… three…”   
   
The holo-wall flared, showing a swirling, turbulent maelstrom. Fifty pinpricks of light and fifty pockets of shadow pulsed, locked in a perpetual, exhausting struggle.   
   
**SIM 03 // God-Cam Feed // T-00:00:00.00**   
   
The God-Cam zoomed into the heart of the maelstrom. It was a constant battle of push and pull. Waves of brilliant white light clashed with swirling vortexes of absorbing darkness. There was no clear progression, no grand expansion, no definitive victory. Just a relentless, grinding conflict.   
   
_ALPHA COHERENCE: FLUCTUATING (NO NET GAIN)._ _OMEGA ENTROPY: FLUCTUATING (NO NET GAIN)._ _SYSTEM STABILITY: AT CRITICAL THRESHOLD._   
   
Mia watched, mesmerized and disturbed. “It’s like they’re just... wearing each other down. No one’s winning, but the whole system is just getting tired.”   
   
Kai pointed at the telemetry. “The quantum interference patterns are perfectly asymmetric. Entropy doesn’t need creativity to destroy, but coherence needs creative capacity to build. Even with equal power, the system is slowly losing overall energy. It’s a thermodynamic crash waiting to happen.”   
   
As the simulation accelerated, the maelstrom itself began to dim, the flashes of light and shadow becoming less vibrant. It wasn't the explosive collapse of pure evil, nor the boundless expansion of pure good. It was a slow, grinding, mutual exhaustion. The very fabric of the simulated universe, caught in this endless stalemate, started to unravel at the edges, like old cloth. The energy readings across the board began to dip, steadily, unstoppably.   
   
LAB AI: “WARNING: SIMULATION 03 THERMODYNAMIC CRASH IMMINENT. SYSTEM DATA INTEGRITY COMPROMISED. RECOMMENDING IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN.”   
   
Kai stared at the screen, a grim realization dawning. “It’s not about who wins, is it? Not in this setup. It’s about who _destroys the whole table_.” He initiated the shutdown, his hand trembling slightly.   
   
LAB AI: “Simulation 03 complete. Runtime 8.7 hours. Result: Mutual exhaustion leading to thermodynamic crash. Ω dominance unsustained. Alpha coherence unsustained. System integrity lost.”   
   
Mia pulled back, rubbing her temples. “So, my mom’s proverb was still too simple. The wolf you don’t feed enough creative energy to… they both lose. The whole system collapses.” She looked at Kai, a new seriousness in her eyes. “So, if pure good overflows, pure bad self-destructs, and a balanced stalemate just leads to cosmic ruin… How does bad ever _actually_ win, Kai? Without everything just ending?”   
   
Kai leaned forward, a strange glint in his eye, pulling up a new data file. "There's one more variable, Mia. The Professor mentioned it. The really dangerous one. The _H-Agent_. This time, we don't just seed. We plant a seed of pure creativity inside the perfect system, and then... we give it a choice."
