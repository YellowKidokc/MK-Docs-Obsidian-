title: Bible Codes and Hidden Meanings in Scripture
---
   
# Bible Codes and Hidden Meanings in Scripture   
   
**Bible codes** refer to a range of techniques for uncovering purported hidden messages or deeper meanings in biblical texts. These include ciphers like equidistant letter sequences (ELS), numerical values of letters (gematria), symbolic patterns and typology, and the study of significant numbers (biblical numerology). Below we explore each approach, notable findings claimed by proponents, and scholarly perspectives on their legitimacy or controversy.   
   
## Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS)   
   
ELS is the method of selecting letters from a text at equal spacing to form new words or messages​   
   
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code#:~:text=The%20primary%20method%20by%20which,spaces%2C%20derives%20the%20word%20%27Safest)   
   
. For example, one might start at a certain letter in Genesis and take every _n_th letter to spell a word. This technique gained fame in 1994 when Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and Yoav Rosenberg published a **Statistical Science** paper claiming that names of famous rabbis and their birth or death dates appear “closer together” in Genesis than random chance would allow. This became known as the “Great Rabbis Experiment,” and the authors suggested such encoded pairings were statistically significant. Enthusiasts argue that long, intelligible phrases found via ELS (e.g. a code about _“Bin Laden”_ and _“destruction”_) are too detailed to be coincidence.

_Example: A grid of Genesis 26:5–10 (KJV) with 21 columns. The red line highlights an ELS that spells “BIBLE,” and the blue line spells “CODE,” demonstrating how skipping letters at fixed intervals can form words._   
   
**Notable ELS findings** (discussed more below) include hidden terms in the Torah that seem to relate to later events or persons – for instance, ELS arrays in **Deuteronomy** were reported to cluster words like “Hitler,” “Berlin,” “Belsen,” and “Auschwitz” together. Another classic ELS claim is that the word “Torah” (Torah) is encoded at 50-letter intervals in the opening of Genesis and Exodus. **Yakov Rambsel**, a Messianic Jewish researcher, even asserted that **Jesus’s Hebrew name** (Yeshua) appears in significant passages. In Isaiah 53 (the chapter of the suffering servant), every 20th letter spells **“Yeshua Shmi”** – Hebrew for “Jesus is my name”. Similarly, Rambsel and others identified “Yeshua” or phrases about him at various skips in the Hebrew Bible (e.g. _“Behold, the blood of Jesus”_ encoded in Leviticus 21).   
   
**Scholarly perspective:** Most scientists and textual scholars are highly skeptical of ELS codes. After the 1994 paper, other mathematicians (McKay, Bar-Natan, Bar-Hillel, and Kalai) published a rebuttal in **Statistical Science** (1999) calling the ELS results “fatally defective,” essentially attributing them to cherry-picked data and experimental design choices. They even demonstrated that similar “code” results could be reproduced in texts like _War and Peace_ by using the same methods. In other words, given a large text and enough computing power, one can find many _seeming_ patterns (this is sometimes called the “look-elsewhere effect” – if you search long enough, random letters will spell words). To poke fun at prophetic claims, Australian mathematician Brendan McKay famously found ELS “predictions” of future events in **Moby Dick**, including the (then future) assassination of Michael Drosnin – a prominent Bible code proponent. In academic circles, Bible codes are often regarded as **pseudoscience** or a statistical parlor trick, not divine encryption. As Nobel-winning game theorist Robert Aumann put it after reviewing the controversy, _“the basic thesis... seems wildly improbable,”_ and even though initial results intrigued him, further analysis led him to conclude any apparent codes were likely due to possible manipulation or **chance**. To date, no code proponent has produced predictive codes that withstand rigorous testing, and spectacular claims (like Drosnin’s prediction of an apocalyptic World War in 2006) have failed, undermining credibility.   
   
## Gematria (Numerical Values and Codes)   
   
**Gematria** is the ancient practice of assigning numerical values to letters, so that words or phrases can be summed to meaningful numbers. In Hebrew (and Greek), each letter corresponds to a number (Alef = 1, Bet = 2, … Yod = 10, … Qof = 100, etc.). This means words have numeric totals – and if two words share the same total, mystics might see a hidden connection. For example, the Hebrew word _chai_ (חי, “life”) equals 18 (ח=8, י=10), making 18 a symbol of “life” in Judaism. It is common for Jews to give donations in multiples of 18 for this reason​   
   
[jewfaq.org](https://www.jewfaq.org/hebrew_alphabet#:~:text=mysticism%20%20known%20as%20Gematria,in%20these%20kinds%20of%20numbers)   
   
. Another famous example: the biblical number “**666**” in the Book of Revelation is linked via gematria to **Nero Caesar**. In Hebrew/Aramaic spelling, “Nero Caesar” (נרון קסר‎ _nron qsr_) adds up to 666, which many scholars believe is the intended reference behind the “number of the beast”. Early Christian writers noted that **888** was a value associated with **Jesus** (in Greek gematria “Ιησους” _Iesous_ = 888) and used this to symbolize Jesus as greater than man (who is 6) and perfection (7).   
   
Gematria has roots in Jewish interpretive tradition. It’s actually listed as one of the accepted methods of biblical interpretation in the Talmud (listed among the 32 _middot_ or rules for expounding Scripture). Rabbis occasionally made homiletic points by noting numerical values. For instance, classic Jewish commentaries observe that the Torah contains 613 commandments, and the Hebrew word “Torah” (תורה) has a value of 611 – implying that Moses gave 611 commandments and the other 2 were spoken by God directly. In the Gospel of Matthew, many believe the genealogy was structured into groups of 14 intentionally: the name **“David”** in Hebrew (דוד, D+V+D = 4+6+4) equals 14, and Matthew emphasizes the Messiah’s connection to David by organizing **14 generations** three times​   
   
[lp.israelbiblicalstudies.com](lp_iibs_jbnt_14_matthew-en.html.com)   
   
​   
   
[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/thou-art-christ-son-living-god/matthews-portrayal-jesus-son-david-new-moses-son-god#:~:text=,28%5D%20It)   
   
. In these ways, gematria and numeric symbolism often overlap (14 becomes a symbol of Davidic kingship​   
   
[betemunah.org](fourteen.html.org)   
   
).   
   
**Scholarly perspective:** As a traditional practice, gematria is acknowledged as part of Jewish _midrashic_ and mystical interpretation. It can yield creative theological insights, but scholars caution that it’s highly **subjective**. Because many Hebrew words can equal the same number, one can draw dubious parallels if not careful. Mainstream academic use of gematria is limited; historians more often study how ancient interpreters used it, rather than use it themselves to decode new secrets. When used, it’s generally to illuminate an author’s intent (e.g. John hinting at Nero with 666) rather than to find modern predictions. Some critics note that with flexible methods (e.g. making selective additions or using alternate alphabets), **any text can yield “hidden” numbers**. Thus, outside of clearly intended cases, gematria findings are seen as interesting curiosities or devotional insights – **not** proof of secret divine codes.   
   
## Symbolic Patterns and Typology   
   
Not all “hidden meanings” involve ciphers or math. Many students of the Bible look for **symbolic patterns, structures, or foreshadowing (typology)** that convey deeper theology. The Bible is filled with deliberate literary structures – for example, many scholars observe **chiastic patterns** (inversion structures) in Scripture, where themes mirror each other in reverse order to highlight a central point. There are also acrostics (like Psalm 119, each section starting with successive Hebrew letters) and numeric patterns (Matthew’s 3×14 genealogy, as mentioned). These aren’t secret codes per se, but they suggest an intentional design beyond the surface narrative.   
   
**Typology** is a form of symbolic interpretation where an element in the Old Testament is seen as a “type” or foreshadowing of something in the New Testament. Classic examples: The prophet **Jonah**’s three days in the fish are a type of Jesus’s three days in the tomb (an analogy Jesus himself makes). The sacrifice of **Isaac** in Genesis 22 is seen as a preview of God offering His own son – with numerous details (a father’s “only son,” the son carries wood up the hill, a ram is caught in thorns as a substitute sacrifice) that Christians interpret as pointers to Christ’s crucifixion. Such patterns, often only fully recognized in hindsight, are sometimes called _sensus plenior_ (“fuller meaning”) – the idea that Scripture has layers of meaning intended by God. The “full intent” may remain **“hidden in plain view” until fulfilled**​   
   
[equip.sbts.edu](https://equip.sbts.edu/publications/journals/journal-of-theology/sbjt-211-spring-2017/biblical-theological-exegesis-nature-typology/#:~:text=understanding%20this%20concept.,given%20insight%20into%20the%20divinely)   
   
, at which point readers look back and see how the pieces fit together. For instance, many details of Israel’s history (the Passover lamb, the Tabernacle rituals, the high priest, the kingly line of David) are, in Christian interpretation, symbolic shadows fulfilled by Jesus.   
   
Beyond persons or events, even subtle structural details can carry meaning. The Gospel of John, for example, is structured around seven “signs” Jesus performs, reflecting the theme of divine completion (and John loves the number seven as a motif). The book of **Revelation** is famously full of symbolically charged numbers, patterns, and imagery drawn from the Old Testament. None of this is _hidden_ in a code sense – it’s communicated through literary design and requires readers to be attuned to biblical symbolism and intertextual links.   
   
**Scholarly perspective:** Interpreting symbols and typology is a mainstream practice in theology – when done with rigor. Scholars differentiate between **legitimate typology** (which the biblical texts themselves seem to invite or which later biblical authors affirm) and uncontrolled allegorical interpretation. There is a fine line between recognizing a pattern and inventing one. Academic consensus accepts that biblical authors used numbers, repetition, and structures purposefully (for memory, emphasis, or theology). For example, the prominence of **40 days/years** as periods of trial (the Flood rain, Israel’s wilderness wandering, Jesus’s fasting) or **12** as a number of covenant people (12 tribes, 12 apostles) is well documented. However, scholars warn against overly speculative symbolism—“reading between the lines” too much. The **literal context (peshat)** must not be abandoned even as one considers deeper layers (in Jewish terms, _remez_ for hint, _drash_ for homily, _sod_ for secret mystical meaning)​   
   
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardes_\(exegesis\)#:~:text=,given%20through%20inspiration%20or%20revelation)   
   
​   
   
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardes_\(exegesis\)#:~:text=Each%20type%20of%20Pardes%20interpretation,instances%20of%20the%20same%20word)   
   
. In short, patterns _in the text_ that reinforce theological themes are widely studied and respected, whereas claims of discovering entirely new doctrines or specific modern predictions via hidden symbols veer into **dubious territory**. Responsible interpretation seeks a balance: it marvels at the literary artistry and interconnections in Scripture without resorting to codes or unfounded “mysteries.”   
   
## Biblical Numerology (Significance of Numbers)   
   
“Biblical numerology” broadly means the study of numbers in the Bible and their symbolic significance. In contrast to gematria (where numbers arise from letters), this focuses on the **meaning of the numbers themselves** as they appear in Scripture’s narratives and prophecy. Certain numbers recur with striking frequency and consistent connotations:   
   
   
- **One:** Unity and primacy (one God​   
       
    [christianity.com](what-is-the-significance-of-biblical-numerology.html.com)   
       
    , one faith, etc.).   
   
- **Three:** Divine presence or completeness – e.g. the Trinity; Jesus rises on the third day; in Isaiah’s vision the angels cry “holy, holy, holy” (threefold repetition) to denote ultimate holiness.   
- **Seven:** The most commonly cited “holy” number, signifying **perfection or completion**. Creation is completed in 7 days; the biblical week is 7 days; Revelation is filled with sevens (7 churches, 7 seals, 7 trumpets, etc.). The menorah in the Temple had 7 lamps, and feasts often lasted 7 days​   
       
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_numerology#:~:text=days%20%287,mankind%20is%20created%20on)   
       
    .   
   
- **Twelve:** Signifies **governmental perfection or God’s people** – 12 tribes of Israel, 12 apostles, 12 gates in the vision of New Jerusalem. It often represents the people of God as a whole.   
- **Forty:** A number associated with **testing or judgment**. Israel wandered 40 years in the desert; Moses stayed 40 days on Sinai; Jesus fasted 40 days; during the Judges period, the land had rest for 40 years at times, only to fall back into trial. A 40-unit period typically precedes a new beginning.   
- **Others:** **Ten** (completeness of order, as in the Ten Commandments), **Four** (the earth or creation – four corners of the earth, four living creatures, etc.), **Six** (often human work or incompleteness, since man is made on Day 6 and 6 falls short of 7; _666_ then emphasizes falling short in the extreme), **Thirteen** (sometimes viewed as rebellion or misfortune, though this is more a later tradition), and so on.   
   
Interpreters through history have derived rich meaning from these numbers. For instance, **St. Augustine** saw 6 as imperfect (since 7 is perfection), and 8 as the number of new creation (Jesus rose on the 8th day, starting a new week). Modern readers notice that the Gospel of John lists **153 fish** in a resurrection appearance scene, which has prompted many creative theories (153 might equal the numeric value of a phrase like “sons of God” in Greek, or be a triangular number (1+2+...+17) symbolizing Gentiles, etc.). While such interpretations can be intriguing, they are often speculative. In general, the **context** usually guides whether a number is merely a count or a symbol. For example, when Revelation speaks of “1000 years,” is it a literal count or a symbol of a long, complete period? Scholars debate these cases vigorously, based on genre and context.   
   
**Scholarly perspective:** There is acknowledgment that the biblical authors used numbers with purpose, especially in apocalyptic or poetic sections. However, academic scholars approach numerical symbolism with caution. They distinguish between reasonable inferences (like seven symbolizing completeness​   
   
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_numerology#:~:text=10%20%20numerical%20system.%20,creation%20and%20so%20seven%20days)   
   
) and unwarranted numerology (using numbers to predict the future or assign hidden codes). Mainstream Christian theology does _not_ endorse using the Bible like a book of mystical numbers to predict dates or lottery numbers – such practices are closer to occult numerology. Even in the text, when numbers carry meaning, that meaning is usually **subservient to the message** (for instance, John structuring things in sevens to communicate theological completeness). Thus, studying biblical numbers is a valid and fascinating field, but it stays anchored in understanding the text’s message, not in divining secret knowledge.   
   
## Notable “Code” Findings and Their Interpretations   
   
Over the years, Bible code enthusiasts have pointed to many startling “discoveries.” Here are some of the most famous or intriguing cases, along with how they are viewed:   
   
   
- **“Yeshua” in the Old Testament:** As mentioned, **Isaiah 53:10** contains an ELS that spells _“Yeshua Shmi”_ (“Jesus is my name”) with a skip of 20. Similarly, **Genesis 3:20–21** at a 9-letter interval spells _“Yoshia”_ (“He will save”), a Hebrew synonym for Yeshua (Jesus). These finds are used by Christian code proponents to claim that Jesus’s role is cryptically affirmed in the Torah and Prophets centuries before the New Testament. Skeptics counter that these are selective and that one could also find random names with enough searching. Indeed, such codes **only appear in the original Hebrew text**, not in translations – so one must accept that the Masoretic text’s letter sequence is divinely fixed (textual critics note variations in ancient manuscripts, which poses a problem for rigid codes​   
       
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code#:~:text=The%20precise%20order%20of%20consonantal,24)   
       
    ).   
       
   
- **The Torah “atbash” in Genesis–Deuteronomy:** A classic observation is that the word “Torah” (תורה) appears encoded at 50-letter skips in **Genesis** and **Exodus** (forward), and in **Numbers** and **Deuteronomy** (backward), almost as if pointing toward the middle book of **Leviticus** – where, instead of Torah, the Name of **YHWH** (יהוה) is encoded at 7 or 8-letter skips. Some see this as a signature of divine authorship, with the Torah literally pointing to God’s name at the center. It’s an elegant pattern if true, but critics again question if this is intentional or a product of chance alignment; nonetheless, it’s frequently cited in Bible code literature for its symmetry.   
       
   
- **Hitler and World War II:** In a dramatic example, researchers found “Hitler” (היטלר) encoded in **Deuteronomy 10:17–22** with a step of 22. In the same area, by taking every 13th letter _backwards_ from a certain point, they got the phrase _“in a bitter sea of Auschwitz”_ in Hebrew. Nearby, names of Nazi camps (“Belsen,” etc.) and words like “Berlin” were also clustered. To proponents, this clustering of related terms (Holocaust references in one passage about Israel) is beyond coincidence – evidence of prophetic encoding. Statisticians respond that with millions of possible combinations, _some_ remarkable clusters will occur. Unless one sets strict criteria _before_ searching, it’s easy to be impressed by retrospectively “connecting the dots.” In fact, one team showed that if you allow enough flexibility, **any large text** can yield similar clusters: they famously discovered assassinations of numerous public figures encoded in _Moby Dick_ (e.g., “Kennedy” crossing “Dallas” with “Oswald”), proving that chance can mimic intelligent design when selective memory is at work.   
       
   
- **The Great Rabbis Experiment:** This was the study that kicked off modern Torah Code fever. Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg compiled a list of 34 renowned rabbis (from medieval times) and searched Genesis for their names alongside their birth or death dates. They reported that the names and dates appeared in close proximity more often than random probability would predict. When the study was peer-reviewed, the journal noted it as a puzzling curiosity (without fully endorsing it). Follow-up analysis by other scholars (MBBK in 1999) argued that the results were likely a product of _experimenter bias_ – the researchers may have chosen spelling variants of names and dates that _fit_ best. Indeed, when the experiment was redone with alternate, objectively chosen spellings, the effect seemed to vanish. No one has convincingly replicated the rabbis experiment in a way that satisfies all critics, and it remains a contentious case. Supporters like Harold Gans (a former NSA cryptologist) defend the original findings and reject the hoax hypothesis, but the broader scientific community remains unconvinced.   
       
   
- **Contemporary Predictions (Michael Drosnin’s claims):** Journalist **Michael Drosnin** popularized Bible codes with a bestselling 1997 book. He went beyond finding past events to claim the codes could predict the future. Drosnin wrote that the code warned of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination, and later editions of his book predicted things like a 2006 world war and a terrorist nuclear attack. These predictions **failed to materialize**. Moreover, analysts pointed out that Drosnin sometimes misinterpreted the Hebrew: one supposed prediction about Rabin actually came from a verse about cities of refuge and included the word “unwittingly,” which would imply an accidental killing – not fitting Rabin’s assassination. Such critiques, along with the failure of any code-based prophecy to come true, have led even some code believers to distance themselves from Drosnin’s approach. They argue the codes are **“not for fortune-telling”**​   
       
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code#:~:text=Again%2C%20the%20results%20were%20interpreted,18%20%5D%20In)   
       
    but rather as faith-boosters, while skeptics say failed predictions underscore the arbitrariness of finding meaning in ELS at all.   
       
   
In summary, the most **compelling cases** of Bible codes often lose their luster under scrutiny. They are compelling _after the fact_, but they lack predictive power and often require generous assumptions. From a scholarly angle, patterns like typology or numeric symbolism have recognized value because they illuminate how the biblical authors composed their messages. But ELS-type codes and heavy gematria are largely seen as modern impositions on the text – fun for puzzles, perhaps, but not taken seriously in academic biblical studies. As one science writer quipped, “if you’re looking for hidden codes, you can find _anything_ if you have enough computing power and enough imagination.” The weight of evidence suggests that many Bible code “findings” are products of human pattern-seeking – a reminder that our brains excel at finding patterns, even when none were intentionally placed there. The enduring lesson is to approach such claims with both an open mind and a critical eye: _“Not everything hidden is a message – sometimes it’s just noise.”_
