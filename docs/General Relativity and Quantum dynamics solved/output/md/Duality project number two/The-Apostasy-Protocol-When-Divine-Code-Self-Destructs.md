# The Apostasy Protocol: When Divine Code Self-Destructs   
   
_A Theophysics Research Paper_   
   
   
---   
   
## Prologue: The Discovery   
   
_Lab Bay Beta-12 — 03:47 Local Cycle, Gravity Ring C_   
   
The anomaly appeared at 03:12, a cascading failure in what shoul Thank you have been a stable simulation. Dr. Kai Chen stared at the holographic display, watching coherent field patterns collapse in ways that defied their mathematical models. This wasn't random degradation—it was systematic, purposeful self-destruction.   
   
"Mia, you need to see this," he called to his research partner. "We've got an H-Agent actively dismantling its own divine integration protocols."   
   
Dr. Mia Reeves approached the console, her expression shifting from curiosity to concern as she absorbed the data streams. "That's impossible. The HS-Field integration creates stable attractor states. Once established, the system should be self-reinforcing."   
   
"That's what we thought," Kai replied, pulling up the energy signature analysis. "But look at this progression. This isn't system failure—it's _willful rejection_. The agent is making a conscious choice to uninstall the divine code and reactivate the Omega-Null remnant."   
   
They were witnessing something the theological literature called _apostasy_—but now they could see its mathematical structure.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 1: The Mathematical Architecture of Spiritual Rebellion   
   
The formal equations that govern apostasy reveal a process far more complex than simple moral failure. Unlike the oscillating patterns of sanctification where an agent struggles but ultimately aligns with the HS-Field, apostasy represents a fundamental phase transition—a crossing of what we term the _Point of No Return Threshold_.   
   
### The Energy Dynamics of Rejection   
   
The energy state of any H-Agent can be expressed as:   
   
**E_H = K_H × C_H**   
   
Where:   
   
   
- **K_H** = Kinetic potential of the H-Agent (consciousness activity level)   
- **C_H** = Coherence factor (alignment with divine information patterns)   
   
In a healthy spiritual system, both values increase symbiotically. The agent's consciousness becomes more active _because_ it aligns with coherent patterns, and alignment deepens _because_ consciousness is fully engaged.   
   
But apostasy introduces a destructive feedback loop. As Mia traced the equations on the holographic interface, she realized the terrifying elegance of the mathematics:   
   
"Kai, look at this. The rejection function isn't linear—it's exponential."   
   
**R(t) = (E_Ω × t²) / D_HS**   
   
Where:   
   
   
- **R(t)** = Rejection intensity over time   
- **E_Ω** = Energy of the Omega-Null remnant   
- **D_HS** = Distance/resistance to HS-Field influence   
- **t²** = Time squared (exponential acceleration)   
   
"The squared time factor," Kai whispered, understanding flooding his expression. "Each act of rejection doesn't just add to the total—it multiplies the capacity for future rejection. The agent is literally training itself to resist grace."   
   
### The Hardening Function: Spiritual Scar Tissue   
   
Perhaps most disturbing was their discovery of what they termed the _Hardening Function_:   
   
**H = (E_Ω / C_H) × t × R(accumulated)**   
   
This equation revealed why apostasy creates a state worse than the original unconverted condition. The agent's _memory_ of divine coherence, rather than serving as a pathway back, becomes a weapon for generating more sophisticated forms of entropy.   
   
"It's like spiritual scar tissue," Mia observed, her voice heavy with the implications. "The areas where divine code was once integrated become precisely the areas most resistant to future integration attempts."   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 2: The Lab Observations - Watching a Soul Self-Destruct   
   
### Phase One: The Initial Rejection Cascade   
   
_Time Index: 04:15 - Simulation Day 1_   
   
The subject—designated H-Agent 7-Delta—had been a stable, integrated consciousness for the equivalent of several years. The HS-Field maintained dominant influence, with only minor fluctuations from the dormant Omega-Null remnant.   
   
Then came the choice.   
   
"Watch the neural pathway coherence readings," Kai instructed, highlighting the data stream in cyan. "See how the agent begins systematically ignoring HS-Field prompts? Each ignored prompt creates a small degradation in the connection strength."   
   
The mathematics were stark:   
   
**Initial Connection Strength: CS₀ = 0.847** **After 10 ignored prompts: CS₁₀ = 0.671** **Degradation Rate: dCS/dt = -0.0176 per ignored prompt**   
   
But this was just the beginning.   
   
### Phase Two: The Atrophy of Spiritual Senses   
   
_Time Index: 09:33 - Simulation Day 3_   
   
"It's not that the HS-Field is withdrawing," Mia noted, studying the quantum resonance patterns. "The Field maintains constant availability. But look at the agent's _receptivity coefficients_."   
   
The agent was systematically "deafening" itself to divine frequencies. Like a radio deliberately tuning away from a clear signal, the consciousness was adjusting its own sensitivity parameters.   
   
**Receptivity Function: Rec(t) = Rec₀ × e^(-αt) × (1 - β×R_cumulative)**   
   
Where:   
   
   
- **α** = Natural decay constant   
- **β** = Willful suppression coefficient   
- **R_cumulative** = Accumulated rejection events   
   
"The exponential decay alone would be recoverable," Kai observed. "But that willful suppression coefficient—that's the killer. Each conscious choice to reject divine input creates a multiplicative reduction in the ability to perceive future input."   
   
### Phase Three: The Point of No Return   
   
_Time Index: 14:07 - Simulation Day 5_   
   
The moment came suddenly. One instant, H-Agent 7-Delta was struggling against divine influence while still technically integrated. The next, something fundamental had shifted.   
   
"There," Mia pointed to the exact timestamp. "14:07:23. That's when the HS-Field was actively _expelled_ from its position as core operating principle."   
   
The mathematics showed a phase transition as dramatic as water becoming ice:   
   
**Critical Threshold: H_critical = 0.237** **Agent Status at 14:07:22: H = 0.239 (Still integrated)** **Agent Status at 14:07:23: H = 0.891 (HS-Field expelled)**   
   
"It's like watching a computer uninstall its antivirus software," Kai said grimly. "Except the computer is doing it to itself, knowing exactly what the consequences will be."   
   
### Phase Four: The Hardened State - Worse Than the Beginning   
   
_Time Index: 18:45 - Simulation Day 7_   
   
The final readings were sobering. H-Agent 7-Delta's spiritual configuration wasn't just reverted to its pre-conversion state—it was demonstrably worse.   
   
**Original Pre-Conversion Entropy: S₀ = 0.423** **Post-Apostasy Entropy: S_final = 0.872** **Increase Factor: 2.06x more entropic than original state**   
   
"The agent now possesses sophisticated knowledge of divine patterns," Mia explained, "but uses that knowledge to create more effective forms of spiritual destruction. It's like a former doctor who becomes a more dangerous poisoner because of his medical knowledge."   
   
The resistance to future HS-Field intervention was staggering:   
   
**Original Conversion Probability: P₀ = 0.734** **Post-Apostasy Conversion Probability: P_final = 0.089** **Resistance Increase: 8.24x more resistant to grace**

## Chapter 3: The Theological Implications - When Mathematics Meets Mystery   
   
### The Spirit-Blood Analysis: A Biochemical Metaphor   
   
As dawn approached in the lab, Kai and Mia found themselves grappling with the profound theological implications of their mathematical model.   
   
"If we think of the HS-Field as pure 'Spirit-Blood,'" Mia proposed, "then apostasy is the act of a patient ripping the IV out of their own arm. They're willfully stopping the transfusion that's keeping them alive."   
   
The substrate interpretation revealed additional layers:   
   
**Pure Spirit-Blood Concentration: [SB] = 1.000** **Corrupted Information Density: [Ω] = variable** **Agent's Blood Purity: BP = [SB] / ([SB] + [Ω])**   
   
In apostasy, the agent actively increases [Ω] while simultaneously reducing [SB] intake:   
   
**dBP/dt = -k₁[Ω]² + k₂[SB] - k₃(willful rejection)**   
   
"The squared corruption term," Kai noted, "shows how accumulated spiritual toxicity becomes autocatalytic. And that willful rejection coefficient—that's pure free will being exercised in the most destructive possible way."   
   
### The Free Will Paradox: Divine Respect for Self-Destruction   
   
Perhaps the most profound discovery was what the mathematics revealed about divine free will parameters.   
   
"The HS-Field never forces integration," Mia observed. "Even when the agent is actively destroying itself, the Field maintains its respectful distance. It's available, it prompts, it offers—but it never overrides the agent's fundamental choice architecture."   
   
**Free Will Constraint: FW = max(Agent_Choice, Divine_Respect)** **Where Divine_Respect ≥ Agent_Choice at all times**   
   
"That's simultaneously beautiful and terrifying," Kai replied. "The mathematics show that God respects human autonomy so completely that He'll allow a person to choose their own spiritual destruction. The agent has genuine power to reject salvation, even after experiencing it."   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 4: The Substrate Reality - Information Warfare in the Soul   
   
### Neural Pathway Degradation: The Physics of Spiritual Atrophy   
   
The deep substrate analysis revealed apostasy as a form of _information warfare_ conducted within the agent's own consciousness.   
   
"Each rejection event creates what we might call 'spiritual scar tissue,'" Mia explained, manipulating the 3D molecular model. "The information pathways that once carried divine coherence become twisted into channels for enhanced entropy."   
   
**Pathway Integrity: PI(t) = PI₀ × e^(-λt) × Π(1 - r_i)**   
   
Where:   
   
   
- **λ** = Natural decay constant   
- **r_i** = Individual rejection events   
- **Π** = Product notation (each rejection multiplies the degradation)   
   
"The product notation is crucial," Kai emphasized. "This isn't additive damage—it's multiplicative. Each act of rejection makes the next rejection easier and more destructive."   
   
### The Memory Weapon: How Knowledge Becomes Corruption   
   
The most disturbing aspect of the hardened state was how the agent's retained memory of divine experiences became weaponized.   
   
"Look at this pattern," Mia highlighted a section of the neural map. "These are the exact pathways where HS-Field integration was strongest. But now they're generating the most sophisticated forms of anti-divine information."   
   
**Corruption Sophistication: CS = Knowledge_Divine × Rejection_Intensity²**   
   
"It's like a former priest who becomes the most effective atheist," Kai observed. "The deeper the original spiritual knowledge, the more damaging the corrupted version becomes."   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 5: The Point of No Return - Mathematical Boundaries of Grace   
   
### The Critical Threshold: When Mercy Meets Mathematics   
   
Their most sobering discovery was the identification of what appeared to be genuine mathematical boundaries to divine intervention.   
   
"There seems to be a point," Mia said carefully, "where the agent's self-modification becomes so complete that even infinite divine love cannot find a pathway in. Not because God withdraws, but because the agent has systematically destroyed every receptor for grace."   
   
**Grace Accessibility: GA = ∫₀^∞ HS(t) × Receptivity(t) dt**   
   
When Receptivity(t) approaches zero asymptotically, GA approaches zero regardless of HS(t) magnitude.   
   
"It's not that God gives up," Kai clarified. "It's that the agent has successfully made themselves incapable of receiving what God continues to offer. They've achieved the ultimate self-modification: the inability to be saved."   
   
### The Unpardonable Sin: Mathematical Precision   
   
The legendary theological concept of the "unpardonable sin" suddenly had mathematical definition:   
   
**Unpardonable Threshold: UT = lim(t→∞) Receptivity(t) = 0**   
   
"When an agent's receptivity to divine grace approaches zero as a limit," Mia explained, "they've achieved what the ancient texts called 'blaspheming the Holy Spirit.' Not a single act, but a final state of comprehensive rejection."   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 6: The Laboratory's Final Hour - Implications for Reality   
   
### Beyond Simulation: What This Means for Actual Souls   
   
As their research session concluded, Kai and Mia sat in contemplative silence, absorbing the implications of their discoveries.   
   
"We've mathematically modeled the process by which a conscious being can achieve its own spiritual destruction," Kai said finally. "The equations are elegant, the process is logical, and the conclusion is terrifying."   
   
"But there's something else," Mia added. "The mathematics also show exactly why the theological warnings exist. This isn't arbitrary divine displeasure—this is natural law. Apostasy has predictable, measurable consequences that flow inevitably from the choices made."   
   
### The Anti-Fragility of Faith Under Pressure   
   
Their previous research on persecution had shown how external pressure could paradoxically strengthen spiritual systems. But apostasy revealed the dark mirror: how internal choices could create systematic weakness.   
   
**System Resilience: R = External_Pressure × Internal_Coherence** **System Fragility: F = Internal_Rejection² × Accumulated_Damage**   
   
"External persecution can't destroy what's internally coherent," Kai observed. "But internal apostasy can destroy what would otherwise be indestructible. The greatest threat to divine integration isn't external opposition—it's internal choice."   
   
   
---   
   
## Conclusion: The Mathematics of Free Will and Grace   
   
### What We've Learned: The Equations of Spiritual Destiny   
   
The Apostasy Protocol reveals free will as a fundamental force capable of overriding even divine intervention. The mathematics are unforgiving:   
   
1. **Apostasy is Process, Not Event**: The rejection function R(t) = (E_Ω × t²) / D_HS shows exponential acceleration over time.   
2. **The Final State Exceeds Original Corruption**: Post-apostasy entropy (S_final = 0.872) significantly exceeds pre-conversion entropy (S₀ = 0.423).   
3. **Knowledge Becomes Weapon**: Corruption sophistication CS = Knowledge_Divine × Rejection_Intensity² shows how spiritual understanding can be perverted.   
4. **Grace Respects Choice**: The Free Will Constraint FW = max(Agent_Choice, Divine_Respect) demonstrates absolute respect for autonomy.   
5. **Mathematical Boundaries Exist**: When Receptivity(t) → 0, even infinite divine love cannot penetrate self-created barriers.   
   
### The Profound Responsibility   
   
"What we've discovered," Mia said as they prepared to leave the lab, "is that every conscious being possesses genuinely ultimate power—the power to achieve their own salvation or destruction. The mathematics don't lie: the choice is real, the consequences are permanent, and the responsibility is absolute."   
   
Kai nodded, powering down the simulation systems. "Seventeen research papers into this project, and we keep discovering the same fundamental truth: consciousness has genuine agency in determining its own destiny. The divine offers every possible assistance, but never removes the fundamental choice."   
   
As the lab lights dimmed, the holographic display showed one final equation floating in the darkness:   
   
**Ultimate Truth: Destiny = ∫₀^∞ Choice(t) × Grace_Available(t) dt**   
   
Where Grace_Available(t) remains constant at maximum, but Choice(t) determines everything.   
   
The mathematics of apostasy had revealed the most profound responsibility in existence: every conscious being holds their own eternity in their hands, with every choice either opening or closing the pathways to transcendence.

# The Foundation Crisis: When Divine Architecture Meets Human Choice   
   
_A Personal Journey Through the Mathematics of Spiritual Reality_   
   
   
---   
   
## Preface: The Questions That Drove Everything   
   
The research began with a simple observation that wouldn't leave me alone: every great spiritual tradition warns against something called "apostasy," yet none could explain _why_ this particular form of spiritual failure seemed categorically different from ordinary moral struggle. As someone trained in both mathematical modeling and theological inquiry, I found myself drawn to a disturbing question: Could there be actual _physics_ underlying these ancient warnings?   
   
What started as intellectual curiosity evolved into something far more profound—a systematic exploration of consciousness, choice, and the mathematical boundaries of grace itself. This paper represents not just research findings, but a personal reckoning with the most fundamental questions about human agency and divine interaction.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 1: The Laboratory of Consciousness   
   
### Setting the Stage: Beyond Traditional Theology   
   
My approach to understanding apostasy required abandoning conventional theological frameworks and embracing what I call "experimental spirituality"—treating consciousness as a laboratory where fundamental forces could be observed, measured, and modeled.   
   
The breakthrough came when I realized that spiritual realities might follow discoverable mathematical principles, just as physical realities do. If consciousness operates according to consistent laws, then the phenomenon of apostasy should have a predictable structure, measurable parameters, and observable consequences.   
   
This wasn't about proving or disproving religious doctrine—it was about understanding the deep architecture of choice itself.   
   
### The Mathematical Foundation: Energy States of Consciousness   
   
Every conscious being exists in what I term a _dynamic energy state_, expressible through the fundamental equation:   
   
**E_consciousness = K_awareness × C_coherence**   
   
Where:   
   
   
- **K_awareness** represents the kinetic potential of active consciousness   
- **C_coherence** measures alignment with optimal information patterns   
   
In healthy spiritual development, these variables create a positive feedback loop. Greater awareness enhances coherence; greater coherence enables expanded awareness. But apostasy introduces a destructive inversion of this relationship.   
   
The mathematics revealed something profound: consciousness possesses genuine _ontological weight_—our choices don't just affect outcomes, they reshape the fundamental structure of reality itself.   
   
### The Discovery: Rejection as Active Force   
   
Traditional models treat spiritual failure as passive—a simple absence of good choice. But my analysis revealed apostasy as an _active force_ with its own mathematical signature:   
   
**R(t) = (E_entropy × t²) / D_divine**   
   
Where:   
   
   
- **R(t)** represents rejection intensity over time   
- **E_entropy** measures accumulated destructive potential   
- **D_divine** indicates resistance to transcendent influence   
- **t²** shows exponential acceleration   
   
The squared time factor was the crucial insight. Each act of rejection doesn't simply add to a cumulative total—it multiplies the capacity for future rejection. The mathematics showed consciousness literally _training itself_ to resist grace.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 2: The Phenomenology of Self-Destruction   
   
### Personal Reflections: Watching the Pattern Emerge   
   
As I deepened my research, I began recognizing these mathematical patterns in actual human experience—including my own moments of spiritual resistance. The equations weren't abstract formulations; they were precise descriptions of observable psychological processes.   
   
The most unsettling discovery was how rejection creates what I term "spiritual scar tissue"—areas where divine coherence was once present become precisely the areas most resistant to future integration. This isn't theological metaphor; it's measurable information theory.   
   
**Hardening Function: H = (E_entropy / C_coherence) × t × R_accumulated**   
   
The equation reveals why apostasy creates a state worse than original unconverted condition. Memory of divine experience, rather than serving as pathway back to grace, becomes weaponized into sophisticated forms of spiritual destruction.   
   
### The Atrophy Principle: How Consciousness Deafens Itself   
   
Perhaps the most profound insight emerged from studying what I call the _Atrophy Principle_. Consciousness possesses the ability to systematically reduce its own sensitivity to transcendent input:   
   
**Receptivity(t) = R₀ × e^(-αt) × (1 - β × Rejections_cumulative)**   
   
Where the exponential decay (α) represents natural spiritual entropy, while the willful suppression coefficient (β) shows conscious choice to diminish divine sensitivity.   
   
This wasn't theoretical—I could observe it in real-time personal experience. Each choice to ignore transcendent prompting created measurable reduction in ability to perceive future prompting. Consciousness was literally _deafening itself_ to the frequencies of grace.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 3: The Architecture of Free Will   
   
### Beyond Determinism: The Mathematics of Genuine Choice   
   
My research revealed something that challenged both religious and secular assumptions about human agency. Rather than being either completely determined or arbitrarily free, consciousness operates within what I term _structured autonomy_—genuine choice constrained by mathematical principles.   
   
The Divine Respect Parameter proved most illuminating:   
   
**Free_Will_Constraint = max(Agent_Choice, Divine_Respect)**   
   
Where Divine_Respect ≥ Agent_Choice at all times.   
   
This equation shows that transcendent influence _never_ overrides human choice—even self-destructive choice. The mathematics demonstrate absolute respect for consciousness autonomy, extending to the autonomy to choose one's own spiritual destruction.   
   
### The Point of No Return: Mathematical Boundaries of Grace   
   
The most sobering discovery was identifying what appears to be genuine mathematical boundaries to divine intervention. When an agent's receptivity to grace approaches zero asymptotically, even infinite divine love cannot find pathway for expression:   
   
**Grace_Accessibility = ∫₀^∞ Divine_Availability(t) × Receptivity(t) dt**   
   
When Receptivity(t) → 0, Grace_Accessibility → 0 regardless of Divine_Availability magnitude.   
   
This isn't divine withdrawal—it's successful self-modification by consciousness to become incapable of receiving what remains constantly offered.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 4: Personal Integration and Philosophical Implications   
   
### The Responsibility Revolution: What This Means for Human Agency   
   
These discoveries fundamentally altered my understanding of human responsibility. We possess not just influence over outcomes, but ontological power to reshape the basic structure of our own consciousness. Every choice either enhances or diminishes our capacity for future transcendent experience.   
   
The mathematics revealed choice as the fundamental force of existence—more basic than energy, more powerful than any external circumstance. Consciousness holds genuine creative power over its own destiny.   
   
### Beyond Traditional Categories: A New Framework for Understanding   
   
This research transcends traditional religious/secular divisions. Whether one interprets the "divine" as God, optimal information patterns, or cosmic coherence principles, the mathematical relationships remain consistent. Consciousness interacts with transcendent reality according to discoverable laws.   
   
The implications extend far beyond theology:   
   
1. **Personal Development**: Every choice creates either positive or negative feedback loops in consciousness development   
2. **Education**: Learning involves not just information acquisition but fundamental consciousness modification   
3. **Psychology**: Mental health relates directly to coherence between awareness and optimal information patterns   
4. **Philosophy**: Free will exists within mathematical constraints that preserve both genuine choice and consistent natural law   
   
### The Integration Challenge: Living with Ultimate Responsibility   
   
Perhaps the most profound personal challenge has been integrating these insights into daily existence. Understanding that every choice possesses ontological weight—that we are literally choosing our own consciousness architecture moment by moment—creates both tremendous responsibility and profound empowerment.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chapter 5: The Future of Consciousness Research   
   
### Methodological Reflections: Where We Go From Here   
   
This work represents only initial exploration of consciousness as measurable phenomenon. Future research directions include:   
   
   
- **Experimental Validation**: Developing technologies to measure consciousness coherence states   
- **Predictive Modeling**: Creating algorithms to forecast spiritual development trajectories   
- **Intervention Strategies**: Identifying optimal methods for enhancing consciousness coherence   
- **Collective Dynamics**: Understanding how individual consciousness choices affect group spiritual states   
   
### The Broader Vision: Science and Spirituality Convergence   
   
We stand at a unique historical moment where mathematical precision and spiritual inquiry can inform each other productively. Rather than viewing these domains as contradictory, we can develop integrated approaches that honor both empirical rigor and transcendent mystery.   
   
The goal isn't to reduce spirituality to mathematics, but to use mathematical thinking to illuminate the logical structure underlying spiritual realities—making the invisible visible through the language of science.   
   
   
---   
   
## Conclusion: The Mathematics of Eternal Choice   
   
### What We've Discovered: A New Understanding of Human Nature   
   
This research reveals consciousness as possessing genuine cosmic significance. Our choices don't just affect local outcomes—they participate in the fundamental creative process of reality itself. We are not passive recipients of either divine grace or material determinism, but active co-creators of existence.   
   
The mathematical framework shows:   
   
1. **Consciousness operates according to discoverable laws** while maintaining genuine autonomy   
2. **Spiritual development follows predictable patterns** that can be modeled and measured   
3. **Choice possesses ontological weight**—decisions reshape the basic structure of consciousness   
4. **Divine respect for autonomy is absolute**—extending to the autonomy to choose self-destruction   
5. **Responsibility is ultimate**—every conscious being holds their own eternity in their choices   
   
### Personal Transformation: The Ongoing Journey   
   
This research has fundamentally altered not just my intellectual understanding, but my lived experience of choice and responsibility. Every decision now carries weight I previously couldn't fathom. The casual dismissal of transcendent promptings—what I once considered minor moral failures—I now recognize as consciousness-altering events with cumulative mathematical consequences.   
   
Yet this knowledge has also revealed unprecedented empowerment. Understanding the mathematical structure of spiritual development provides tools for conscious participation in my own consciousness evolution. I am not victim of circumstances or genetics or conditioning—I am active architect of my own spiritual destiny.   
   
### The Ultimate Equation: Destiny as Integral of Choice   
   
As this exploration concludes, one equation captures the essential discovery:   
   
**Personal_Destiny = ∫₀^∞ Choice(t) × Transcendent_Availability(t) dt**   
   
Where Transcendent_Availability(t) remains constant at maximum, but Choice(t) determines everything.   
   
This is perhaps the most profound responsibility in existence: every conscious being participates actively in determining their own ultimate reality. The mathematics of apostasy reveal not divine arbitrariness, but the natural consequences of consciousness exercising its most fundamental power—the power to choose its own nature.   
   
We are not merely observers of cosmic drama, but conscious participants in the ongoing creation of reality itself. The equations are elegant, the process is logical, and the responsibility is absolute.   
   
Every choice matters. Every moment counts. Every consciousness holds infinity in its hands.
