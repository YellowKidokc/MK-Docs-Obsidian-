### Narrative Brief: The Patriarchs (Genesis 12–36) and the Archaeological Record   
   
The biblical narratives of Genesis 12–36, which detail the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, fall into the Middle Bronze Age, a period for which archaeology cannot provide direct evidence for the existence of these individuals. Mainstream scholarly consensus, since a paradigm shift in the 1970s, has moved away from the idea that the patriarchal narratives are a strictly factual historical record. Instead, they are widely viewed as literary or theological compositions written centuries later, likely in the Iron Age, that reflect the social, legal, and cultural customs of the time of their writing.   
   
However, this does not mean that archaeology is silent on this period. Instead of seeking direct proof, archaeology provides a rich cultural and historical backdrop that suggests the narratives are rooted in real-world contexts and traditions. For instance, the legal and social customs found in the 15th- to 14th-century BCE Nuzi tablets, unearthed in modern Iraq, contain striking parallels to the patriarchal stories. These include customs such as a childless wife providing a slave to her husband to bear an heir (echoing the story of Hagar) and the significance of household gods in inheritance disputes (reminiscent of Rachel stealing her father Laban’s idols). While these parallels do not prove the historicity of the patriarchs, they demonstrate that the social world described in Genesis was not a later invention but was grounded in the authentic cultural milieu of the ancient Near East.     
   
Similarly, archaeological discoveries at sites mentioned in Genesis provide plausible circumstantial evidence. The strategic location of ancient Shechem, situated in a valley between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, aligns perfectly with the biblical narrative. Excavations have revealed a gap in settlement at Shechem during the time Abraham is believed to have visited, but a fortified city with a gate had been established by the time of Jacob, a distinction that is accurately reflected in Genesis. At the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, while the massive Herodian structure over the site does not prove the patriarchs' existence, pottery from the First Temple period found in the caves suggests the site was an important pilgrimage destination for centuries before the common era.     
   
A major point of debate revolves around the destruction of the “Cities of the Plain.” The sites of Bab edh-Dhra and Numeira, situated on a geological fault line southeast of the Dead Sea, show clear evidence of destruction by fire. This has led to the theory that a seismic event could have ignited subterranean bitumen deposits, causing a fiery conflagration consistent with the biblical account. However, this theory is controversial, as the destruction of these sites is generally dated to circa 2350 BCE, which is several hundred years earlier than many biblical chronologies place the events of Genesis 19. Additionally, some archaeologists argue that the two sites were destroyed approximately 250 years apart, and that Bab edh-Dhra shows no evidence of a significant conflagration at all, challenging the theory of a single, simultaneous catastrophe. These debates underscore the complexity of harmonizing biblical texts with archaeological data, where the dating and interpretation of evidence are often the central issues.
