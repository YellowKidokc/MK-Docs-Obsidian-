### Narrative Brief: Judges and Ruth (Judges; Ruth)   
   
The period of the Judges and Ruth (c. 1375–1100 BCE) marks a transitional era in the Southern Levant, following the Late Bronze Age collapse and preceding the rise of the Israelite monarchy. The biblical books of Judges and Ruth depict a time of tribal life, intermittent warfare with neighboring peoples, and a cycle of religious apostasy and deliverance. For this period, archaeology does not provide a linear, point-for-point confirmation of every narrative, but it offers a rich and dynamic cultural backdrop that lends historical plausibility to many of the biblical accounts.   
   
A cornerstone discovery for this era is the Merneptah Stele, dating to approximately 1208 BCE. This Egyptian inscription is the earliest known extra-biblical reference to "Israel" and confirms that a people group by that name was already present and significant in Canaan by the late 13th century BCE. The hieroglyphic symbol used to denote "Israel" on the stele identifies them as a semi-nomadic or rural people rather than a fortified city-state, which aligns perfectly with the biblical description of a tribal confederacy in the period of the Judges.     
   
Archaeological finds also illuminate the presence of Israel’s rivals. Excavations at Philistine sites like Tel es-Safi (ancient Gath) have provided strong corroboration for the biblical narratives involving this people group. While a Goliath-sized warrior has not been discovered, inscribed potsherds from the 10th century BCE at the site bear names with Indo-European linguistic roots similar to the Hebrew name for Goliath (_Galyat_), supporting the Philistines' Aegean origins as described in the Bible. Similarly, the biblical account of Samson’s death in a temple of Dagon finds a striking parallel in the architectural remains of Philistine temples at Tel Qasile and Tel Miqne. These temples featured two central wooden pillars that, when dislodged from their stone bases, could cause the roof to collapse, precisely matching the description of Samson’s final act.     
   
A significant scholarly debate for this period concerns the statehood of kingdoms east of the Jordan River. While the biblical text describes Edom and Moab as established kingdoms in the time of the Exodus and Judges, the archaeological record is complex. Some archaeologists argue that these regions were sparsely settled by pastoral nomads and did not achieve statehood until much later, around the 8th to 7th centuries BCE under Assyrian influence. This suggests a chronological tension between the biblical account and the material evidence.   
   
In summary, the archaeology of the Judges and Ruth period reinforces the historical reality of the world in which the biblical stories are set. It does not provide biographies of the judges themselves, but it validates the geopolitical context, the presence of key groups like the Philistines, and even specific cultural practices and architectural designs that are woven into the fabric of the biblical text.
