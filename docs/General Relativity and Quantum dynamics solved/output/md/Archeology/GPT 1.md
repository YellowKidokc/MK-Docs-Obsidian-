title: Patriarchs (ca. 2100–1700 BC) – Genesis 12–36

## Patriarchs (ca. 2100–1700 BC) – Genesis 12–36   
   
The Middle Bronze Age (MBA) archaeological record provides a general backdrop consistent with the Patriarchal narratives, even though no direct inscription naming Abraham or his family has been found[bibleinterp.arizona.edu](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2018/04/gur428005#:~:text=Additional%20considerations%20may%20be%20raised,a%20key%20for%20his%20survival)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=Abraham%20traveled%20from%20Haran%20in,a%20fortification%20wall%20of%20large). In this period, Canaan was dominated by fortified city-states and a mix of peoples (Amorites, Canaanites, Hurrians, etc.), matching the Bible’s depiction of Abra oh anyway do something that's expensive Always get caught I have no idea I know these things I'll help you out yeah right Oh man this is just like it's just too weird like I mean you don't have to deal with yourself now yeah I mean I got plenty to do but it's just like not what I plan I got to finish up this **** credit **** I'm almost done with it with this round anyway yeah you need to be online and look at the Olive Garden hours for tomorrow and how would I get my shifts away Although that would look a little weird I gave a Tuesday away or Wednesday pick one up see what happens yeah I need money I did not see this coming I did not think that's what you were going to say I thought the dog died or something Dog died you were in here with my dog why could the dog die oh no have you had another dog my mean Co pounding Maybe you should be sorry You should be real **** sorry You know what you mean 60 Excuse me That's 55 It's about Olive Garden but this was the first night I mean they couldn't go up from here And I was telling David Olive Garden they didn't even have another schedule they'd taken me off and then they added me back on Sunday and nobody said anything to me about it nobody explained it nobody asked me anything and they give me a really great section Yeah we're just slow give me 34 times Yeah now you got a lot of free time Well maybe we'll see i'm gonna try and pick up some chefs at Olive Garden not the same days that I just dropped ham’s interactions with various local rulers[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=names%20for%20rulers%20and%20sites,addition%20to%20Amorite%20names%2C%20other)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=architecture%2C%20donkey%20burials%2C%20and%20pottery,the%20Lord%20through%20the%20prophet). Egyptian texts from the 19th–18th centuries BC confirm the prominence of cities like **Salem (Jerusalem)** and **Shechem** in Canaan: The Egyptian Execration Texts curse the “king of Rushalimum (Jerusalem)” and other Canaanite cities[bibleinterp.arizona.edu](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2018/04/gur428005#:~:text=Additional%20considerations%20may%20be%20raised,a%20key%20for%20his%20survival), indicating these places were inhabited and important during Abraham’s time. Excavations in Jerusalem’s City of David have uncovered massive Middle Bronze walls and a tower defending the Gihon Spring, dated by pottery to roughly the time of Melchizedek (traditionally contemporaneous with Abraham)[armstronginstitute.org](https://armstronginstitute.org/226-archaeology-reveals-jerusalems-origins#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20this%20large,mighty%20Egyptian%20empire%20pay%20it)[bibleinterp.arizona.edu](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2018/04/gur428005#:~:text=All%20these%20elements%20were%20dated,4). Likewise, digs at **Shechem (Tell Balata)** revealed large earth ramparts, thick stone fortifications, and a large **fortress-temple** first built in the MBA[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=followed%20the%20ridges%20of%20the,Abraham%20did%20not%20have%20much)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=the%20later%20phases%20of%20the,Throughout%20the%20ancestral%20narratives%2C%20Abraham) – evidence that Shechem was a major urban center when Jacob camped “before the city” (Gen. 33:18). Rural life is also attested: A cuneiform tablet from **Hebron** (17th century BC) records flocks of sheep and goats being taxed by local officials (including women) and even refers to a local “king,” implying a settled community around Hebron in this era[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=Faunal%20remains%20from%20archaeological%20excavations,of%20the%20sheep%20or%20goats). This tablet’s contents – enumerating livestock and their wool/shearing – resonate with the pastoral economy portrayed in Genesis[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=found%20during%20excavations%20at%20Hebron,taxed%20in%20such%20materials%20in). Tombs and burials in the Hebron area were used continuously from MBA into Iron I[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=Philip%20Hammond%2C%20an%20excavator%20of,a%20burial%20place%20for%20the)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=Philip%20Hammond%2C%20an%20excavator%20of,hundred%20shekels%20of%20silver%20to), supporting the tradition of the **Cave of Machpelah** as an ancestral family tomb. In Mesopotamia and Syria, contemporary texts like the **Mari letters** (18th c BC) reflect a world of semi-nomadic clans, covenant treaties sealed with animal sacrifices, and personal names of West Semitic flavor[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=21%3A22%E2%80%9334%29,establishment%20of%20covenants%20and%20the)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=you.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D,if%20the%20covenant%20is%20forfeited), all of which parallel Patriarchal customs. Taken together, archaeology confirms that the general setting of Genesis (nomads grazing flocks amid Canaanite city-states) is plausible for the early second millennium BC[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=names%20for%20rulers%20and%20sites,addition%20to%20Amorite%20names%2C%20other)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=architecture%2C%20donkey%20burials%2C%20and%20pottery,its%20Canaanite%20roots%3A%20%E2%80%9CYour%20origin).   
   
_Middle Bronze Age mudbrick gate at Tel Dan (Laish), 18th century BC._ This impressive arched gateway – often nicknamed “Abraham’s Gate” – exemplifies the fortified cities of Canaan in the Patriarchal age[ngsba.org](https://ngsba.org/excavations/tel-dan/#:~:text=Among%20the%20significant%20finds%20were,These). Abraham himself pursued enemies “as far as Dan” (Gen 14:14); while this particular gate was built a bit later than Abraham, its existence shows the kind of urban infrastructure his descendants (and later biblical authors) knew. Such massive defenses and city gates underscore that Abraham’s sojourns took place in a land of well-established towns, not empty deserts[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=monumental%20architecture%20and%20large%20fortification,interesting%20scenario%20of%20local%20Canaanite)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=large%20fortress,away%20from%20such%20urban%20centers). Outside the cities, pastoral camps did exist – regional surveys in the Negev and hill country have identified Bronze Age nomadic encampments and water sources along the routes the Patriarchs likely traveled[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20archaeological%20surveys%20have%20recorded,as%20waystations%20and%20trading%20posts).   
   
**Debated or Contrarian Views:** The historicity of the Patriarchs remains debated. Mainstream historians often view Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as legendary or composite figures, noting that we lack definitive archaeological proof of their existence. Some scholars argue the Genesis stories were written much later (Iron Age) and may contain anachronisms[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=Scripture%20records%20that%20Abraham%20had,humped). For example, Genesis mentions camels as pack animals, but archaeological evidence suggests **domesticated camels** became common in the Levant only around the 10th–9th century BC[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=this%20is%20incorrect%2C%20an%20anachronistic,humped). Camel bones are almost absent in Bronze Age strata; a study of copper-mine sites in the Aravah dated the earliest camel remains to around 930 BC, implying that references to camels in Abraham’s time could be narrative updates[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=Scripture%20records%20that%20Abraham%20had,third%20and%20late%20second%20millennium). (Some counter that camel petroglyphs and a bronze camel figurine from as early as ~1900–1700 BC indicate limited camel use earlier[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=until%20the%20late%20second%20millennium,humped), but this is a minority view.) Another debate concerns the **“cities of the Plain” (Sodom and Gomorrah)**. Archaeology shows that sites like **Bab edh-Dhra and Numeira** near the Dead Sea were fortified towns violently destroyed by fire around 2500 BC[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=Genesis%2014%3A1,accurately%20reflect%20conditions%20in%20the) – long before Abraham – whereas Genesis would place the destruction closer to 2000 BC. Some conservative researchers propose a lower date for those destructions or identify other sites (e.g. **Tall el-Hammam** in Jordan, destroyed c. 1650 BC) as Sodom[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=7), but no consensus exists. The famous battle of Genesis 14 (Abraham vs. Mesopotamian kings) is also scrutinized: names like _Kedorlaomer_ and _Arioch_ resemble historical figures (Kutir-Lagamar of Elam, Arriwuk/Arioch of Larsa) from the early second millennium BC[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=Genesis%2014%3A1,hold%20to%20the%20documentary%20hypothesis), which some interpret as preserving genuine memory[biblearchaeologyreport.com](https://biblearchaeologyreport.com/2021/07/16/top-ten-discoveries-related-to-abraham/#:~:text=millennium%20later%2C%20as%20those%20who,14). Others remain skeptical, noting the lack of direct mention of this campaign in Mesopotamian records and suggesting the story serves a literary or theological purpose. In summary, archaeology **corroborates the general MBA context** of the Patriarchs – a world of camel caravans, sheep folds, walled towns, and Amorite princes – but it **cannot confirm specific individuals**. The narratives likely preserve authentic customs and place names of the MBA[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=names%20for%20rulers%20and%20sites,addition%20to%20Amorite%20names%2C%20other)[rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/creation-sinai/ancestors-israel-environment-canaan-early-second-millennium-bc#:~:text=21%3A22%E2%80%9334%29,establishment%20of%20covenants%20and%20the), even if the exact deeds of the Patriarchs cannot be historically verified. Scholars therefore range from “maximalists” who see Genesis accurately reflecting the MBA setting, to “minimalists” who see it as later fiction retrojected into a hazy past. The evidence on the ground neither definitively proves nor disproves the Bible’s Patriarchal stories – it only illuminates their cultural and geographical backdrop, leaving room for both faith and skepticism.

## Exodus & Sinai (ca. 15th–13th c. BC) – Exodus 3–40, etc.   
   
The archaeological picture for the Exodus is complex and much debated. The **Hebrew Exodus from Egypt** (if it occurred as described) would have taken place either in the **15th century BC (~1446 BC)** or **13th century BC (~1270 BC)**, according to different biblical interpretations. However, Egyptian records are largely silent about any mass departure of slaves or catastrophic plagues, and the nomadic nature of the Israelites in the wilderness leaves little material trace. That said, archaeology provides clues that **Semitic peoples were present in both Egypt and Sinai/Canaan** around the late Bronze Age, setting a plausible context for the Exodus saga[medium.com](https://medium.com/@greyslayer76_59122/yahweh-and-the-shasu-nomads-5bcca1773f4e#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Amenhotep%20III%E2%80%99s%20Inscription%20,Yahweh%3A%20Recent%20Archaeological%20Perspectives%2C%202004)[medium.com](https://medium.com/@greyslayer76_59122/yahweh-and-the-shasu-nomads-5bcca1773f4e#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Ramesses%20II%E2%80%99s%20Topographical%20Lists,of%20the%20Old%20Testament%2C%202003). For instance, excavations at **Avaris (Tell el-Dab‘a)** in the Nile Delta – the city identified with the biblical “land of Goshen” where Israelites sojourned – reveal a large Asiatic (Canaanite) population settled there during Egypt’s Second Intermediate Period (c. 1800–1550 BC)[madainproject.com](https://madainproject.com/avaris_statue#:~:text=The%20%27Avaris%20Statue%27%20is%20part,Egyptian%20ruler%20of%20Avaris)[madainproject.com](https://madainproject.com/avaris_statue#:~:text=In%20a%20robbers%27%20pit%20sunk,stick%20at%20his%20right%20shoulder). These settlers, possibly ancestors of the Hebrews, prospered for a time. Archaeologist Manfred Bietak discovered at Avaris the remains of semitic-style houses and tombs; notably, one tomb (No. 1) contained a colossal **statue of an Asiatic dignitary** with distinctive mushroom-shaped hair and a multicolored coat[madainproject.com](https://madainproject.com/avaris_statue#:~:text=In%20a%20robbers%27%20pit%20sunk,stick%20at%20his%20right%20shoulder)[madainproject.com](https://madainproject.com/avaris_statue#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20the%20seated,Bietak%201996%3A%2020%E2%80%9321). The statue (later broken) likely represents a foreign official of high rank circa 1700 BC – a tantalizing parallel to Joseph’s rise to power, though mainstream scholars stop short of calling it “Joseph’s statue.” By around 1550 BC, Avaris was abandoned when the Hyksos (Semitic rulers of northern Egypt) were expelled – an event some see as a potential template for a historical “Exodus” (albeit led by the Egyptians, not Moses).   
   
In the **New Kingdom period (15th–13th c BC)**, Egyptian documents and inscriptions give glimpses of Semitic groups and even the name of Israel’s God in the regions the Bible associates with the Exodus. A victory stela of Pharaoh **Merneptah** (c. 1208 BC) boasts, _“Israel is laid waste, its seed is no more”_[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merneptah_Stele#:~:text=ysr%E1%BB%89%EA%9C%A3r%20fk,seed%2Fgrain%20%20his%2Fits)[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merneptah_Stele#:~:text=The%20Merneptah%20stele%20is%20considered,35) – the earliest known mention of “Israel” in Canaan, implying that by the late 13th century a people called Israel were established in Palestine. This aligns with a **“late-date” Exodus** scenario (c. 1270 BC under Ramesses II), since it suggests Israel was present in Canaan shortly thereafter. Additionally, inscriptions from **Soleb and Amara (Sudan)** from Amenhotep III’s reign (14th c BC) refer to a nomadic group called _“the Shasu of YHW”_[medium.com](https://medium.com/@greyslayer76_59122/yahweh-and-the-shasu-nomads-5bcca1773f4e#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Amenhotep%20III%E2%80%99s%20Inscription%20,Yahweh%3A%20Recent%20Archaeological%20Perspectives%2C%202004) – seemingly _Yahweh_, the Israelite deity. This indicates that a group in Edom/Midian (south of Canaan) worshiped Yahweh centuries before Israel’s monarchy, dovetailing with the biblical account of Moses first encountering Yahweh in Midian (Exodus 3) and the idea that early Israel’s God was associated with the desert regions[medium.com](https://medium.com/@greyslayer76_59122/yahweh-and-the-shasu-nomads-5bcca1773f4e#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Amenhotep%20III%E2%80%99s%20Inscription%20,Yahweh%3A%20Recent%20Archaeological%20Perspectives%2C%202004)[medium.com](https://medium.com/@greyslayer76_59122/yahweh-and-the-shasu-nomads-5bcca1773f4e#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Ramesses%20II%E2%80%99s%20Topographical%20Lists,of%20the%20Old%20Testament%2C%202003). Such evidence doesn’t prove the Exodus but shows the cultural matrix in which it’s set: West Semitic peoples under Egyptian dominion, some even carrying a devotion to “YHW” in the wilderness.   
   
Archaeologists have also identified physical remains consistent with the Exodus/Wilderness traditions, albeit without Israelite labels. In the **Sinai Peninsula**, at sites like **Serabit el-Khadim** (turquoise mines) and **Timna** (copper mines), scholars found inscriptions in the earliest alphabetic script (Proto-Sinaitic) created by Canaanite laborers around 1600–1500 BC[library.biblicalarchaeology.org](https://library.biblicalarchaeology.org/sidebar/mining-the-history-of-the-alphabet-at-serabit-el-khadem/#:~:text=Mining%20the%20History%20of%20the,script%20is%20called%20Old). These Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions – scratched on mine walls and small sphinx statuettes – show a Canaanite dialect and worship of a deity that some read as “El” or “Baalat”. One controversial inscription has been interpreted by a few as mentioning “Moses” (Moshe), but this reading is not widely accepted[archaeologymag.com](https://archaeologymag.com/2025/07/moses-may-be-named-in-egyptian-mine-inscriptions/#:~:text=Moses%20may%20be%20named%20in,Ron). What is widely accepted is that Semitic slaves or workers were present in Sinai during the New Kingdom, leaving behind the **invention of the alphabet** (a remarkable contribution traditionally, though fancifully, attributed to the time of Moses receiving the law). Moreover, the absence of large Late Bronze sites in the Sinai has been used as an argument against the biblical 40-year Israelite encampment. Yet archaeologists note that nomads leave scant traces; ephemeral camps with tents, dung, and skin shelters vanish quickly. Intriguingly, a few sites like **Kadesh-Barnea (Ein el-Qudeirat)** – where Israel stayed long – do show Egyptian-era remains (e.g. a 13th–12th c. Egyptian fortress), but nothing conclusively “Israelite.” In Transjordan, sites such as **Tell Deir ‘Alla** preserve Late Bronze/Iron I evidence of settlements that might be tied to itinerant groups (though linked more to stories like Balaam).   
   
**Debated or Contrarian Views:** The historicity of the Exodus is one of the most disputed questions in biblical archaeology. On one hand, **no direct archaeological evidence** (like an Egyptian record of plagues or a stele by Moses) has surfaced. Skeptics argue that a migration of ~600,000 men (per Exodus 12:37) – over 2 million people including women and children – is not supported by the demographic and settlement data. Surveys in Sinai haven’t found layers of camp debris or graves to match such a host. **Egyptian chronicles** are silent about any pharaoh losing an army in the sea or a slave population escaping (though Egyptian sources rarely admit defeats). These gaps lead many scholars to regard the Exodus as theological mythology or a memory of smaller-scale events. On the other hand, there are **circumstantial evidences** and plausible scenarios. Some propose the Exodus narrative is a conflation of historical kernels: the **Hyksos expulsion** (1550 BC, when Semitic rulers were indeed driven out of Egypt) and the **Apiru slave labor** under Pharaohs like Seti I or Ramesses II (who built Pi-Ramesses in the Delta – note Israelites “built Pithom and Rameses” per Ex. 1:11). There is proof that Semitic slaves made mudbricks for Egyptian projects; for example, an 13th-c BC papyrus (Anastasi V) complains about “looking for runaway slaves” and about workers lacking straw for bricks – evocative of Exodus 5[biblical-archaeology.org](https://biblical-archaeology.org/en/publications/merneptah-stele-cairo-museum-egyptologist-proof-of-israel-in-canaan/#:~:text=Merneptah%20Stele%2C%20Cairo%20Museum%3A%20Egyptologist,)[biblical-archaeology.org](https://biblical-archaeology.org/en/publications/merneptah-stele-cairo-museum-egyptologist-proof-of-israel-in-canaan/#:~:text=He%20also%20claims%20in%20line,). Another papyrus (Brooklyn 35.1446, c. 1740 BC) lists domestic slaves with Semitic names (Menahem, Issachar, etc.), showing that **Hebrew-named people were enslaved in Egypt** long before the Exodus would have happened[britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraham#:~:text=There%20have%20been%20many%20surprising,%E2%80%9CHebrews%E2%80%9D%29%20mentioned). As for the route and **Mount Sinai’s location**, that too is debated: Traditional Mt. Sinai (Jebel Musa in the southern Sinai Peninsula) was identified centuries later and has no Late Bronze remains. Alternatives have been suggested – e.g. **Har Karkom** in the Negev, which has many Bronze Age cult sites but was deserted by 1200 BC[bibleinterp.arizona.edu](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/Anati_Mount_Sinai#:~:text=questioned%20the%20traditional%20belief%20that,or%20after%20the%202nd%C2%A0millennium%20BC)[bibleinterp.arizona.edu](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/Anati_Mount_Sinai#:~:text=13th%C2%A0century%20BC%20and%20had%20assumed,or%20after%20the%202nd%C2%A0millennium%20BC), or Jebel al-Lawz in NW Saudi Arabia (a fringe theory lacking scholarly support). No definitive proof has validated any site as the real Sinai, and the **“station list”** of the Israelites’ journey (Numbers 33) doesn’t clearly match known geography. The **Conquest of Canaan** that follows the Exodus is likewise in tension with archaeology: key sites like **Jericho** and **Ai** show destruction layers that don’t neatly line up with a 1400 BC invasion (Jericho’s walls fell c. 1550 BC per Kenyon[bibleinterp.arizona.edu](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2018/04/gur428005#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20this%20is%20indeed%20the,6), and Ai was a ruin long before Joshua). Some scholars reconcile this by proposing a **smaller exodus** or multiple departures of Semitic groups, followed by a gradual infiltration into Canaan rather than a blitzkrieg conquest – an idea supported by the continuity of Canaanite material culture in Iron I highland villages. In summary, the Exodus narrative contains motifs that echo real historical elements (enslaved Semites, a sudden escape or expulsion, a sojourn in deserts where nomads worshiped Yahweh, emergence of Israel in Canaan by 1200 BC), but these elements may span different times and circumstances. The **majority of archaeologists** today remain cautious: while Israel’s identity as former slaves from Egypt could preserve a distant memory, the spectacular details of the biblical Exodus (10 plagues, Red Sea parting, Sinai theophany) are not corroborated by archaeology and are often considered matters of faith or later literary embellishment. Nonetheless, ongoing discoveries – like Egyptian records of **calamities (e.g. the Ipuwer Papyrus)** describing the Nile turning to blood and chaos in Egypt (possibly 17th c BC) – continue to fuel discussion. Did a volcanic eruption (Thera) inspire the plague narratives? Did a smaller band of proto-Israelites flee Egypt and their story amplify over generations? These questions keep the Exodus at the center of the dialogue between scripture and spade, with archaeology providing context and constraints, if not a full confirmation.
