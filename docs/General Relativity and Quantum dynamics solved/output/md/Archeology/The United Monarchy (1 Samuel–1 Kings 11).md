### Narrative Brief: The United Monarchy (1 Samuel–1 Kings 11)   
   
The period of the United Monarchy, traditionally associated with the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon (c. 1050–931 BCE), has been one of the most contentious time-slices in biblical archaeology. For many years, a school of thought known as biblical minimalism or low chronology argued that the biblical narrative of a powerful, centralized kingdom was a later, exaggerated literary creation with little to no historical basis. This view was based on a lack of widespread monumental architecture and inscriptions from the 10th century BCE that would be expected of a major empire.   
   
This extreme position, however, has been seriously challenged by a number of key archaeological discoveries. The most significant of these is the Tel Dan Stele, a fragmented victory inscription from the 9th century BCE that explicitly names the "House of David". This singular artifact provided the first extra-biblical proof of King David’s existence as a historical figure and the founder of a royal dynasty, effectively ending the debate over whether he was a real person or a myth. The debate has since shifted to a more nuanced question: what was the actual size and nature of this United Monarchy?     
   
The debate over the scale of David and Solomon’s kingdom is at the heart of the "Low Chronology" controversy. Archaeologist Israel Finkelstein, a key proponent of this view, argued that monumental structures traditionally dated to the 10th century BCE, such as the famous six-chambered gates at Megiddo, Gezer, and Hazor, were actually built later, during the 9th century reign of King Ahab. This model would reduce David and Solomon's kingdom to a small, tribal chiefdom in the Judean hills, detached from a larger, central state. Conversely, scholars like Amihai Mazar and Eilat Mazar have presented counterarguments and evidence, including monumental structures in Jerusalem and the dating of the gates based on hand-burnished pottery and carbon-14 samples from sites like Khirbet Qeiyafa. The existence of a strongly fortified city at Khirbet Qeiyafa, dated to the time of David, has been used to argue that the kingdom was more extensive and urbanized than the minimalists claimed.     
   
Ultimately, archaeology for the United Monarchy does not confirm every detail of the biblical text, particularly the descriptions of immense wealth and a vast empire. However, it does provide a plausible historical framework for the existence of a central state during this time, led by a dynasty founded by a historical figure named David. The discoveries demonstrate a gradual process of state-building, with a recognized royal dynasty, a developing bureaucracy, and an increasingly sophisticated material culture, all of which lend credibility to a central, if perhaps smaller, kingdom than the one imagined by some biblical accounts.
