## **Logical Analysis of Salvation Algorithm Framework:**   
   
### **Step 1: Universal Belief in Good and Evil**   
   
   
- **Logical Strengths:**   
       
   
    - Highly intuitive; aligns with nearly universal moral intuition.   
           
   
    - Easily establishes a baseline understanding.   
           
   
- **Potential Weaknesses:**   
       
   
    - Subjectivity: definitions of good and evil can vary significantly among cultures.   
           
   
- **Probability of Acceptance:**     
    **~95–99%** (high intuitive appeal, minimal resistance)

### **Step 2: Animal vs. Human Consciousness**   
   
   
- **Logical Strengths:**   
       
   
    - Clearly distinguishes moral culpability based on consciousness.   
           
   
    - Aligns well with philosophical consensus about moral responsibility.   
           
   
- **Potential Weaknesses:**   
       
   
    - Assumes agreement on animal consciousness/souls without exploring gray areas (highly intelligent animals).   
           
   
- **Probability of Acceptance:**     
    **~85–95%** (minimal pushback; intuitive, widely agreeable)

### **Step 3: Mixed Moral Nature (Good and Evil coexist in Humans)**   
   
   
- **Logical Strengths:**   
       
   
    - Empirically observable; almost impossible to deny.   
           
   
    - Sets stage logically for needing some form of resolution (salvation).   
           
   
- **Potential Weaknesses:**   
       
   
    - Virtually none; universally observable.   
           
   
- **Probability of Acceptance:**     
    **~98–99%** (nearly impossible to dispute logically)

### **Step 4: Need for Salvation (Due to mixed moral nature)**   
   
   
- **Logical Strengths:**   
       
   
    - Flows naturally from previous points.   
           
   
    - Logical inevitability: if good and evil coexist in us, then we logically "fall short" of perfect goodness.   
           
   
- **Potential Weaknesses:**   
       
   
    - Potential philosophical objection: relativism (but relatively easy to counter).   
           
   
- **Probability of Acceptance:**     
    **~90–95%** (minor resistance from relativists, overall strong logic)

### **Step 5: Ultimate Justice Must Exist Beyond This Realm**   
   
   
- **Logical Strengths:**   
       
   
    - Directly follows from moral intuition (justice must exist somewhere).   
           
   
    - Addresses clear empirical issue: justice is incomplete or flawed in this world.   
           
   
- **Potential Weaknesses:**   
       
   
    - Some might resist leap to transcendence; could argue justice is just a human construct.   
           
   
- **Probability of Acceptance:**     
    **~80–90%** (some philosophical skepticism possible)

### **Step 6: Justice vs. Mercy Paradox (Perfect Judge Problem)**   
   
   
- **Logical Strengths:**   
       
   
    - Strong philosophical/logical coherence: clearly defines paradox.   
           
   
    - Almost perfectly sets up the need for a "divine solution."   
           
   
- **Potential Weaknesses:**   
       
   
    - Minimal; possible abstract objection about "perfect" justice or mercy definitions.   
           
   
- **Probability of Acceptance:**     
    **~85–95%** (logical robustness high)
