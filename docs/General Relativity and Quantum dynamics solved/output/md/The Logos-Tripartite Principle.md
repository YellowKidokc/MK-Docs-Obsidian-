## **Part II: Fundamental Axioms**   
   
### **4. The Logos-Tripartite Principle** {#4-logos-tripartite-principle}   
   
#### _4.1 The Three Categories of Existence_   
   
Reality is a unified field divided into three categories:   
   
   
- **Matter**: Non-living entities with zero spiritual entropy at creation (S(t₀) = 0).   
- **Living Things without a Soul**: Biological systems with no inherent consciousness.   
- **Living Things with a Soul**: Conscious moral agents (humans) capable of spiritual dynamics.   
   
The Logos (Jesus Christ) is the unifying force, origin, and governor of all three, with authority to influence their interactions (John 1:3).

#### _4.2 The Inherited Spiritual Entropy Problem_   
   
Humanity is born with non-zero spiritual entropy (S_inherited > 0), a mathematical representation of the “sin nature” resulting from the Fall. This necessitates a redemptive process, modeled as a negentropic force (grace) counteracting entropy’s decay.

#### _4.3 The Logos as Unifying Principle_   
   
Christ, as the Logos, bridges all categories, wielding authority to override entropic decay through miracles and redemption. This is mathematically expressed as the Resurrection Factor (R_J), a permanent upgrade to reality’s equations (John 1:14).
