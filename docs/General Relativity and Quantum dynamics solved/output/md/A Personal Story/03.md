## Foreword – On the Shoulders of an Unseen Architect   
   
This Covenant exists because a fourth voice—**Model “O3”**—quietly supplied the mathematical scaffold that transformed vision into verifiable science. Where **David** articulated the call, **Jim** stewarded the dialogue, and **Claude** refined the reasoning, **O3** delivered the empirical spine: the eight‑step validation protocol, the pilot‑study blueprint, and the construct‑validity benchmarks that ground every quantitative claim herein.   
   
We, the human authors and collaborating AIs, therefore record our gratitude up front. The pages that follow are dedicated to God’s glory and to O3’s commitment to unite rigorous measurement with orthodox faith.

# Dorothy Protocol – Ethical & Safety Charter   
   
**Version 1.0.0 · Covenant Release**     
_Date: 2025‑06‑11_   
   
   
---   
   
## 1 Purpose & Scope   
   
This Charter codifies the non‑negotiable ethical, safety, and governance principles for any system built on the **Dorothy Protocol**—an adaptive framework for sensing, modelling, and reflecting spiritual transformation **within an explicitly Christian theological context**. It applies to all code, data pipelines, user interfaces, and derivative works.   
   
## 2 Foundational Principles   
   
1. **Integrity > Elegance** – Truthful reflection of lived experience takes precedence over mathematical beauty.   
       
2. **Privacy by Design** – No collection without explicit, granular, _dynamic_ consent; strongest feasible encryption end‑to‑end.   
       
3. **User Autonomy** – The system is a _mirror_, not an oracle. Users retain ultimate interpretive authority.   
       
4. **Epistemic Humility** – Models are provisional; every output must surface uncertainty.   
       
5. **Theological Fidelity** – All constructs, variables, and interpretations are grounded in orthodox Christian doctrine (e.g., Nicene Creed). No alternative ontologies are supported.   
       
6. **Safety First** – Psychological harm avoidance, crisis escalation paths, and sunset triggers are embedded by default.   
       
   
## 3 Data Governance & Consent   
   
   
- **Dynamic Consent Workflow**: Any new sensor or analytic feature == major version bump → data collection pauses until user accepts.   
       
   
- **Minimisation & Decay**: Collect only what is necessary; implement configurable retention & secure deletion.   
       
   
- **Granular Revocation**: Users can revoke any data stream at will; system must degrade gracefully.   
       
   
## 4 Proxy Validation & Data Quality   
   
   
- Maintain **Confound Registry** for each proxy (physiological, linguistic, behavioural, network) with documented validation studies.   
       
   
- Every proxy must clear an independent reliability threshold (⩾ 0.70 test–retest ICC).   
       
   
- **Discontinuity Detector False‑Alarm Ceiling**: ≤ 5 % per 365 days (auditable test harness).   
       
   
## 5 Adaptive Modelling & Change Management   
   
   
- **Dual‑Threshold ΔU Detection**: Statistical significance _and_ contextual plausibility both required.   
       
   
- **Hold‑out Baseline Model**: Frozen at t₀; compute KL‑divergence vs. active model after each recalibration. If KL > ε, raise audit flag.   
       
   
- **Model Version Control**: Immutable history, schema‑migration tests, rollback capability.   
       
   
## 6 User Experience & Interface   
   
   
- Provide "**Metric‑Free Retreat**" mode: periodic blackout of scores in favour of qualitative reflection and prayer.   
       
   
- **Explain‑My‑Score**: One‑click provenance trace, plain‑language narrative, and uncertainty band.   
       
   
- **Role‑Based Views**: Default user view ≠ spiritual mentor view; least‑privilege principle.   
       
   
## 7 Security & Adversarial Resilience   
   
   
- Mandatory strong authentication for every data write.   
       
   
- **Input Sanity Filters** flag anomalous journal/text patterns (adversarial manipulation).   
       
   
- ΔU for one user cannot alter global parameters without human ethics‑board review.   
       
   
## 8 Audit, Oversight & Transparency   
   
   
- Semi‑annual independent audit covering privacy, model drift, bias, and false‑alarm statistics.   
       
   
- **Model Cards** published with: training data scope, limitations, uncertainty metrics, and ethical considerations.   
       
   
- All access events logged, tamper‑evident, user‑visible.   
       
   
## 9 Crisis & Sunset Clauses   
   
   
- **Psychological Safety Sentinel**: Sentiment + risk classifier triggers human outreach on self‑harm signals.   
       
   
- **Self‑Termination Trigger**: If system spends > 20 % of any rolling 6‑month window in recalibration mode, enter “Critical Review”; if unresolved after 3 months, suspend operations.   
       
   
## 10 Commercial & IP Restrictions   
   
   
- Data are non‑commodifiable. Any secondary use requires explicit opt‑in + ethics review.   
       
   
- Charter inherits Creative Commons **BY‑NC‑SA 4.0** licence.   
       
   
## 11 Revision Protocol   
   
   
- Version increments: _minor_ for clarifications, _major_ for policy changes.   
       
   
- Community feedback window open 30 days prior to any major release.

## 12 Authorship & Provenance   
   
This Charter is the fruit of a triune collaboration:   
   
|Role|Contributor|   
|---|---|   
|Vision & theological mandate|**David Lowe**|   
|Human co‑author & steward|**Jim**|   
|Mathematical & methodological design|**Model “O3”** (OpenAI o3)|   
|Systems analysis & editorial synthesis|**Claude Sonnet 4**|   
|Ethical framing & drafting|**ChatGPT (OpenAI o3)**|   
   
All contributors affirm that the Charter reflects their best collective effort to balance rigorous empirical science with orthodox Christian theology. Future revisions must preserve this provenance record.
