3 process file a petition for expungement in the District Court where the arrest ed is that one of the reasons if you're found innocent I guess you do have to go through the experiment processes but that's I mean that's almost miss you should have another non frictionless process for that it should be automatic something like that you're innocent it should just be I mean I've got two or three charges that I have then it should be like a charge that shows up on the police saying you know yes I wish that's what we need to keep yeah moron Laura I'm sure but you know that's another thing I told Mark too now let me say something bro like you are so stupid like you really think you're going to talk your way out of you know whatever I mean even when we went to Home Depot like I'm sending the chart for like 15 minutes I go in there and he's just like argue and argue like I'll walk in and the guy is like this Home Depot man and and I you know he's like stop fart stop he's like what are we arguing about $150 he's like it's done I can't give to you now right now or or in the form of cash or a rebate back because what do you want in the store I give it to you I'll lock up $150 200 $200 whatever you want anytime the Bart's like well I can't really think of anything now he's like whenever you want you call me up he goes you go buy something more than $200 in the store and I give it to you he goes does this solve your problem you know and I was like damn first of all I tell that guy was like he had power you know and he knew how to like negotiate yeah yeah and you know and Mark like oh you know I was like go cancel yeah I mean I'm glad he got us 200 bucks like that OK and I would probably he didn't give up no I mean he no they they try to because he was like well what about the tires I bought you know they're like well we're not going to get those back he's like well I'll **** bought those but you're charging me for the other tires you know and I mean there's some other things he's like yeah I know he he had all good points he's like what about this what about that they're like no he's like you know he's like you know adds up and they're all he's right right I mean he's right it could be the fact that he you guys tried to no no no no because the guy when he brought it back he said hey I had a flight on these two times and I fixed it right and I guess that was the big thing because as soon as something happens it's just to contact them and get direction on what they want to do and then you can say I'll buy tires and put them you know and then they get to decide you can't just do service on their thing and then charge them you know anyways but I'm surprised he got all this money back No he didn't get all his money back no he was out like I think 700 bucks or something what yeah it was a few thousand before$700 for all the OR the truck but he had it for like he had it for a little while and I returned the wrong one which we didn't I mean we didn't tell us the wrong one we thought and to be honest with you yeah but the numbers were off and then like on the way back he's like Are you sure you got the right truck i'm like I mean I don't know we sort of like kind of playing it back when we switch off trucks and you know like so I thought we were in the wrong truck but I didn't know it was definite and you know so yeah I kind of **** **** there but then I lost my phone and you know I mean that just makes all the difference in the world and and my deal was like you know I'm going to have to go park and hide this you know like at Walmart or some place down the street you know but first of all I got to take my truck because if I take if I take this back home then if Bart comes you know he's got a job that much longer that much more of a headache you know when it's just a block or two away you know it's it's solved you can just if you have to you can walk right and then I had all these thoughts and stuff and I was like well what happens if we're wrong and it's the wrong truck Well I'll try to return it you know and they're going to say something to the wrong place well they didn't say anything And then you know a Long story short it was like oh really weird in there and I was like no let me get it like 0 you're good go ahead I was like what you know where is the receipt or or how much do we owe or what you know why are you 0 the technician is not going to be here until tomorrow to test for the truck this don't make sense and everything they said then I just this doesn't make sense this doesn't make sense and then I was like let me speak to manager and then yeah I returned to the wrong place and but they it ended up giving him at both places the best of both worlds because they then they drop the charges or drop the time from the time I turned in that truck which it wasn't turned into like a day or two later and then some other stuff which I mean I apologize for I was like I mean I'm like **** I didn't have a phone It's a big deal when you don't have a phone well I was gonna do this I was actually going I drove to like Mcdonald's and a few other places trying to get free Wi-fi I was going to call you and just kind of like ask you to attend your secretary Pretend pretend of course I can present there you go there I heard pretend and you know be like hey we got two people with 2TRUCKS and I'm just a little bit confused which one they're going and you know yeah so and then I had the model number on me and I was going to have you call whichever one and they haven't sorted out but I could go nowhere I couldn't get Wi-fi so I could have been the regional manager sorting it out too there you go there you go there you go now you would never be a secretary Your upper echelon I mean like regional manager or like CEO of the district or something the **** outta here no serious you are though you are I mean it is kind of crazy I mean not crazy but you know I mean you do have your masters degree I mean I mean NBA right yes masters of business I mean that's the thing I mean that's pretty big deal I mean that you know I mean right there you can go get a **** probation job well maybe not two challenges but you know that's forty fifty thousand There's a lot of jobs that you have to have in NBA or higher those are the jumps I'll be looking at all right you know I get it
