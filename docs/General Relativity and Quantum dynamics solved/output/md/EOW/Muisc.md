Before I interviewed Donald I'm an optimist and also a realist and I believe ultimately this political system we're in right now they're going to be a different ways if you look close they're both leaving us a lot in exactly the same place deception is the name of the game before my mom left this world she said to me great the world is going to hell in the handbasket now the hell part I always got the handbasket part I wasn't right she was it appeared to her that the world is coming apart of the siege for no apparent reason and there is a sequence of events and the process has a beginning and an end and we're in that process that we are barreling down the road towards this convergence point cosmologically geologically economic all these cycles are converging and it's how we respond to those cycles the struggle between good and evil is driving our response and if we don't know that if we allow ourselves to be deceived and it's so easy because you see it in music my wife's a voting member of the Grammys and we have this conversation all the time and where the evil is coming up in musical not just lyrics but in the way the music is is performed does it enhance or deny our divinity and I think we have to keep coming back to that anything that denies our divinity our ability to heal and imagine and create and forgive and love is an expression of evil doesn't mean the people know their evil i'm not saying that i'm saying that there are people that have a propensity for greed and control who will fall into evil practices they may not even know
