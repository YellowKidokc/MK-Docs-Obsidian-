The amount of time you spend at home in versa correlated to your success professionally in the home is for seven hours of sleep and that's it The amount of time you spend at home inversely correlated to your success professionally and romantically you need to be out of the house you should never be a man some of that might be testosterone but some of it is the woman said maybe you can you look better than our love I like it just like that baby i'll tell about your ball here take it to your fall asleep do I have any women in here that knows that you can talk to men until the next minute OK that's true Do you wish more women knew about how men operated Ohh yeah that's almost any question you have about your everything i'm a Democrat and a Republican on an iceberg and on the way there I had my 1st 5 orgasms and it never stopped dial has been unable to work since the accident and is mostly housebound with a fear of experiencing an episode in public that he enjoys playing Frisbee golf with his closest friends oh God they happen at all times in any situation they happen when I'm awake Sleep they happen in the shower you still watch lots of stuff last month Holocaust Subaru we ain't **** around dog whose clients so do they the biggest trick of the modern world was making women believe that working out from an airplane is freedom Staying at home theresa family that loves you is sleeping all of that so they can collect double the taxes   
   
The biggest trick of the modern world was making women believe that working eight hours a day for a stranger and leaving kids with daycare is freedom and staying at home to raise a family that loves you is slavery all of that so they could collect double the taxes the biggest trick of the model you looked at the cost of the risk benefit Hey guys 10X growth conference By age 25 you should be old enough to realize this most people have cripples anymore it turns out we never did all this time they were physically challenged it's an attempt to make people feel better physically challenged now is this one differently abled if you insist on using differently abled then you must include all of us we're all differently able each of us can do things the other can't differently abled the word cripple is not a dishonorable word there's no shame in it jesus healed the cripples he didn't engage in rehabilitation Strategies for the physically disadvantaged it's good though continuing problem with the word fact I use that term because they're fat that's why we call it fat people they're not large they're not stout they're not junkie hefty or plump and they're not big bone dinosaurs are big boned and they're not necessarily obese obese is a medical term and they're not overweight overweight implies there is some correct weight there is no correct weight heavy is also a misleading term an aircraft carrier is heavy it's not fat bullying people are fat and that's what fat people are they're fat but they're not gravitationally disadvantaged it's not intended as criticism or insolvent simply descriptive language you don't have cripples anymore you phrase of the day is so here is how your body burns energy by the way That boys kidding on my son I was getting 'em My boy is getting up an organization on the planet and I sat down with the head of training and I asked him raise a question which is how do you choose who gets on this team and he pulled out a piece of paper and he drew or an XY axis for me And on the verbal axis he lived the word performance and on the horizontal axis he wrote the word trust Clearly everybody wants this person on their team the high performer of high trust obviously but they learn is that this person over here the high performer of low trust is a topic team member and they would rather have a medium performer of high trust sometimes even a low performer high trust it's a relative scale however the high performer of low trust if you look at business we have a million metrics to measure people's performance and we have negligible to no metrics to measure somebody's trustworthiness And then we take toxic team members who are high performing and we promote them and eventually they become toxic leaders he is good this is the **** be dropping some **** bro i'm not going to be dropping shut the **** You know that I really do is **** prayers around school right you're **** fat and he's very fathers i'll tell you what i'm right here

this way The coolest tightest possible so the curls are you a sales pro dylan sweetheart nothing but the best is good enough for me I like to eat lobster directly from me I like to see bull fights in Sunny Old Spain I'm going to stop Hi Sanjay I have $10,000 what should I do with my money easy answer put it into an S and P500 index fund and leave it there for the next fifty years you are young that is going to take This opportunity to encourage some of you to go back into the closet not everyone not everyone just you weird ones who are ruining it for the rest of us if you think drag Queen story hour is a good idea back in the closet if you think transitioning minors is OK back in the closet if you think the teachers should have pride flags in their classrooms back in the closets and especially you guys who act out all your weird stuff in public get back in the closet Just go just get back in there apparently it's national coming out today so I wanted to take this opportunity so here's a soy that you've hired the wrong people you have to start making stupid roles all of a sudden you're like I can't believe I have to tell people to stop watching Netflix on the job or like don't steal each other's food or don't show up to a work of it drug it's like these are obvious things and then you wonder man these people are so dumb the only person never do that we the person who's hiring them it's a great limit when somebody works hard because that's who they are not because they're expecting a resolve i'll know When somebody does great work because that's who they are the worst thing somebody could tell me is if I got paid for I work harder **** you and somebody says that to me I'm pretty much gonna walk him out the door I don't get paid enough to do that bye bye I show up because of who I am not because of what I'm getting paid which is why you couldn't put a **** dollar amount of what I do see the difference by the way if you were truly excellent at what you do you can name your price if you can't name your prices because you're not very good at what you do if somebody is indispensable to me they can name their price There's very few people are Because that means you have a high value skill set that you take very seriously and you the youngest child is often the strongest in the family people assume they have everything they need that they're carefree spoiled or that life has always been easier for them But they forget the youngest carries a quiet weight too they're expected to just go with the flow to adjust if you go to Mcdonald's anywhere in the world you will find a french fries or chips as you call them and you will find that they're always made from the same potato the Burbank potato this is a potato from America that's unusually long And difficult to grow and but that's what they want because when you're mcdonald's you like those red boxes with a little bouquet a very long chips It looks really good and so they
