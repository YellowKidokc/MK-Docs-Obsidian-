But Jesus healing a blind man is one of the craziest stories in the entire Bible but it's even crazier when you realize who the blind men are so the story opens in Matthew Chapter 9 by saying as Jesus went on from there there are two blind men followed him now something already ain't had no because it just said that they were blind so how do they know where they going the Bible uses this to patients who articulate to us an active example of Romans 10:17 which states faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so to simplify this God is trying to teach us how important it is to walk by faith and not by sight now this is enough to turn the whole church out even though they couldn't see where they were going they could still move on the Lord's word the take says they called out to him have mercy on us son of David verse 28 says when he had went indoors the blind man came to him and he asked them do you believe I can do this they responded by saying yes Lord and why is that important because in the previous verse they addressed him as the Son of David when you see Jesus as only the Son of David you see a Carpenter and you get your house fixed but when you see Jesus as the Lord you see God and you get your life fixed He wanted to know how they saw him with the eyes in their heart verse 29 says then Jesus touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done unto you and their vision was restored OK here it is and I'm through we are the blind God is trying to show us that he is not ignoring our vision or our prayers but in order for us to see what God has for us we have to be able to trust his voice when we can't trace his steps the story of Jesus You gonna make it out of this thing successful I promise you I guarantee you this ain't the end you might come out with all type of scratches and scratch you may be bleeding and crying but if it's one thing I know is that the Lord ain't gonna let your story end this way and I know that because his name attached to you you're not the only one in this you're not in this alone gives him a bad reputation he has a 100% success rate in your current area of trouble people on **** **** everything you want them right now we get off track the story of Jesus healing the blind three into a new season will be determined by your willingness to exit in old man this is one of the most important seasons of your life but I'm telling you now it's going to require a new attitude you cannot step into two weeks ago after she's gonna have to come in you can't   
   
   
and I don't eat estr mentality that y'all I had no idea the story about Jesus calm in the storm has so much about Jesus calming the storm had so much to do with life today but boy God broke this text all the way down y'all listen to this so in March chapter 4 verse 35 the story opens by saying that day when evening came Jesus said to his disciples let us go to the other side now before we move forward it's important for you to understand what a Bible specifically says that day this is to indicate that there were other things that also transpired on that day and the disciples right there to experience it all now don't forget that because you gonna need it later on verse 36 says leaving the crowds behind they took him along just as he was in the bowl now if you don't get anything else make sure you get this in this verse the Bible is trying to teach us that if you want to say hello to some new places you have to 1st be willing to say goodbye to some old people now don't miss this notice how the Bible says they took him along it doesn't say he took them that's because the Bible is trying to teach us that God will never invite himself into a place that you haven't first welcomed him into Verse 37 says a furious storm came up and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped so it seems as though it must have been smooth sailing in today encounter something I was unexpected what do you do when the very thing that you're trying to stay on top of seems like it's now getting on top of you but watch this this didn't all happen at once the text says they were nearly swamped so that's a clear indication that it had to have been going on for a while figuratively speaking sometimes the ranges isn't taken seriously until we see that the rain is what can take us out These tapes can be interpreted to show us how sometimes we don't start looking for Jesus to help us until we realize we can't help ourselves speaking of Jesus where was he at when all of this was going on the Bible says Jesus was in a stern sleeping on a cushion now I can't say I blame Jesus because I know how good I sleep when it's raining and he was a human so he probably was thinking the same thing but the disciples said to him teacher do you not care if we drown so Jesus got up rebuked the wind and said to the waves quiet be still then the wind ran out of bread and the water was as smooth as glass jesus then said to his disciples why are you so afraid do you still have no faith now this is why I told you to remember that verse earlier jesus didn't ask this question to embarrass them he asked this question because he knew they had watched him perform miracles all day yet they still questioned what he was capable of and there are several lessons throughout this text but I know somebody needs to hear this even when you're doing what the Lord has told you to do you're still going to run into some storms but as long as he's in your boat we're going to make it through so trust who God has shown you that he is and just know whatever storm you may be going through assuming you give it to God the sooner you find the peace you've been looking for   
   
   
Well I had no idea the story about Jesus calming the storm had worked and I don't eat y'all i've been studying the Bible for years So what I just discovered in the book of Matthew may have topped everything so the story opens in chapter four by saying then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil and wait why would the Spirit of God lead Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted because up to this point Jesus had performed no miracles in his ministry had not been made known to the public This portion of the story is trying to exemplify to us that God will always have you prepared in private for an act that he will have you perform in public sometimes what the devil uses to tempt us God uses to train us the text says after fasting 40 days and 40 nights Jesus was hungry the tempter came to him and said if you are the Son of God tell these stones to become bread now don't miss this up to this point the Bible doesn't give us any context of Jesus openly expressing that he was the Son of God so how did the devil come to this conclusion Is possibly because he had already been in heaven with Jesus before so he knew God when he saw him see the hate that some people have for you isn't because of anything you did it's simply because it's hard for them to accept that y'all come from the same place which y'all aren't in the same position now notice how the devil didn't immediately go to Jesus hunger he went to his identity because if the enemy can hinder you from seeing who you are he will simultaneously stop you from being who you are and even the devil knows God will not bless a character he did not create now watch this when Jesus answered Satan saying it is written man shall not live on bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God he wasn't just quoting scripture he was also saying that to enforce authority over his life he was saying that to show us and the devil that even though his emotions were high they would not be his decision maker God's word would be now this part is extremely important jesus is known as the second the devil was trying to do to in the wilderness what he did to the first Adam in the garden he was trying to convince him to eat now why is that important because if you look close enough you'll see that the Bible is trying to show us that the enemy only has so many schemes the devil knew exactly who Jesus was and he also knew that there was nothing that he could do to destroy him so his only strategy left was to try to deceive Jesus into making a decision that would destroy himself y'all I would have to make a whole series just to break down the story but for the second time I'll leave you with this Jesus never denied his hunger Hungrier for his assignment he was willing to live without what he was longing for because he knew what would ultimately satisfy his longing was not the thing that would temporarily satisfy him in that moment so hear me clearly and the only way you don't make it is if you allow yourself to be deceived into distraction this chapter requires supreme focus the desires and cravings will still be there but you can't do what Jesus did unless you have the appetite Jesus had you have to be hungrier for your purpose to worry about Jesus calm in the storm   
   
   
has so wasted for purpose y'all God came through with another word today that I've read several times but I never realized how lost I was you might want to get your popcorn ready for this one because God happen to show you something so in Luke chapter 15 Jesus is hell in a parable of the lost Son but what if I told you there are some details about this character that can only be discovered through the Father so you got to listen closely because if you aren't paying attention you'll miss some commonly overlooked component the story opens with the father of two sons being demanded by younger son to give him his inheritance so he can go and live however he wants to so the father does just as the Son suggests and watch this the Bible doesn't give us any indication of the Father treating the two boys differently so it wasn't the Father's activity that created the division it was the younger sons interpretation in this story his youthfulness is a spiritual metaphor for immaturity what he saw his restriction should have been seen as protection the Bible is trying to articulate to us that when we refuse to learn through the Father's instruction we'll be forced to learn through a life experience But notice how the Father didn't stop him from doing what he wanted to do this is to reiterate and exemplify how God grants us free will now I don't have kids but I'm sure we've both been around long enough to discover this every good parent knows sometimes you have to give a child what they want y'all God came through with another word today that I would   
   
   
God gifted you to do this this is what you do it don't matter how many people are doing it I promise you there's not another soul on this planet that can do what you do the way this is to you and we got to break it several times while I've been studying the Bible for Jesus calming the storm has so nowhere if this don't work then I don't eat that's the mentality that you got to have but what you have to make the decision to go everything around you is about to change and the story of Jesus healing a blind man is going to get off track one thing you struggle and you will be absolutely foolish to think that after all the stuff God has seen   
   
It would be stabbed spit on killed everything you watched the entire thing and it hurts you because you know that you're not worth all that trying to tell them stop you don't have to kill him for me I'm not worth taking somebody else's life jesus looks up at you and he sees .000 001 percent above your head when that percentage represents the chances of you ever loving him back and even that small percentage is enough for Jesus to say I'm willing to die for that even as small as the odds may be if I can have a relationship with that person I'm willing to die for it so don't let nobody try to tell you the value God Himself said you were valuable enough for Him to come down to this earth get beat and bruised and killed just so he could have a relationship with you that's how much you cost   
   
if you OK listen because I feel like God is trying to talk to somebody let's think about your GPI never knew what God meant by living water in the Bible but I asked him and this is what he gave me he said water does not seem to be appealing until you're dehydrated for most people water is not their first choice on their list of drinks why would it be it's not appealing it has no flavor there's so much more out there that you can get full off of like why choose water over A good soda or Kool Aid or Gatorade or anything like that he said but the thing that's the healthiest for you isn't wanted until this movie he said and that's how some of y'all treat me like I'm an emergency guard a lot of people don't want me if there's something that can quench the thirst at that time but the moment they find themselves in an emergency   
   
the thing that keep them alive when really if they just stayed hydrated they would never get deep hydrogen and I'm just like wow thank you thank you I never knew what God meant OK listen because I thought I talked to somebody let's think about if you want to know how much God loves you
