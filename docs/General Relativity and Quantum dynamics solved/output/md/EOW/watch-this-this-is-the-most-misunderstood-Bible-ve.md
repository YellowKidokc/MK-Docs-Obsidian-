watch this this is the most misunderstood Bible verse in the whole New Testament matthew 5 if you write I cause you to sin gouge it out if your right hand cause you to sin cut it off and throw it away for years as a pastor I thought that Jesus was just using hyperbole to tell us to take sin so seriously that we were willing to like commit a radical amputation of anything in our life that causes us to sin wow that's true the meaning is deeper and it is mind blowing here's the clue so in the verse immediately before Jesus mentions another body part when he says if anybody lusts they've committed adultery in their heart and the whole purpose of the sermon amount is that actions are just like fruit they go from the tree of the heart so here's like this mind blowing secret hidden imagine a lustful man that touches a woman inappropriately so he cuts off his hands but then he realizes man I can still listen my eyes so he cuts out his eyes but then he realizes he can still say simple things cuts out his tongue and on and on and on it goes and he never seems to be able to cut off a part of him that causes him to send jesus is saying in order to do that you're going to need to cut out your heart and I can do that for you Christianity is not primarily behavior modification it's about heart transformation watch
