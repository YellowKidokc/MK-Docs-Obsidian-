Well let me explain it in a way that really helped me kinda understand this spiritually done thing so a glove was made in the image of a hand right 5 fingers so that a hand can fit inside the glove and with the hand the glove is useful you can use it and it has a purpose but without the hand the glove is lifeless yeah does that make sense OK so talk with me in the same way we were created in the image of God right so that God can live inside of us and with God have purpose were filled with this power were filled with this strength and without God we're spiritually dead so that makes sense I think it does surprisingly
