You know there's a part of the Easter story that we often overlook Saturday the day after the cross but before the resurrection the day when everything fell silent and I felt like hope was gone but just because it felt hopeless it didn't mean that hope was gone god was still working or the disciples were still awakening and the world thought that death had won god was preparing the resurrect and on the 3rd day Jesus rolls so if you're in a season of waiting where feels like God is silent On your praying what it feels like you're not getting an answer don't give up what feels like a silent Saturday may just be the day before a resurrection what is still working even when you can't see it Hope you're still alive even when it feels far away and if Jesus conquered the grave there is no situation ignore like two dead for him the written back to life so hold on keep praying Keep truth Sunday is going you know there's a part of these my camera made
