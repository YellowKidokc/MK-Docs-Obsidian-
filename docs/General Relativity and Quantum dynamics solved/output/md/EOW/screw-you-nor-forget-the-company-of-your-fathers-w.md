screw you nor forget the company of your father's which he swore to them street terms the second way to break the addiction is to obey God which means to hear his commands and to take action if you just heard a command and you didn't move you didn't actually hear so whatever China is building a 1 super high speed when God starts blessing you I flew to the other time everybody from the air Boston will smile with you from the beginning of the flight to the end they treated you like a king the moment we got in they brought the menu and they are talking to you so politely they are suggesting to you what you can start with and all of that and you told me this because we are coming it was a 7 hours flight they were dark knights and polite The end of the flight anytime you call them they call with a smile hello Sir how can I help you sometimes you just want to call them and your thing is just about the air Hostess the moment we enter the airport first of all the airport was like A the moment you enter the airport everybody with you welcome Waco in fact I wanted to go to a lounge the person that was attending to me told me where that lounge is too far from my gate the gateway can be connected like so he will suggest I take a train to the next lounge and he called somebody to walk me in case I miss my way with all the signs and the person walking me was talking politely suggesting to me about how the nation is what the nation votes for and all of that is not part of a salary but they are trying to sustain weakness and courtesy And I went to the lounge sat down somebody came to me would you like anything to drink sad the next time I wanted to fly that route was longer but I said we use it where are you you are still in the kiosk and every customer that comes you are fighting with them come over there if you know what your business be done you will go nowhere you are you are patching tire and from patching tire you have party enemies everyday if you like God another person will come you will never impact your world No value system he said they make listen thank God for the power the only goes that fail here but their channels you may be very powerful yet rotting on security that's why there are many preachers raising the dead nobody cares if they're dead There are many businessmen who can solve every problem in the world but nobody cares about their intelligence because your first encounter with them they were already insulted I flew to the other time everybody from the air
