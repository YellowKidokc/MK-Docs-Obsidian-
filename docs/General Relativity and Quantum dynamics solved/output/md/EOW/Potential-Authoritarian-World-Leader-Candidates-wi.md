Not broadly charismatic in the West, but domestically many see him as Russia’s savior.                                                                                               | **1** – Faced assassination plots and a recent armed mutiny; so far survives every crisis. No clear “fall” – though the ongoing war has weakened Russia, Putin himself remains in power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **1** – Was once seen as a cold, cunning “always-in-control” strategist, but missteps (like underestimating Ukraine) show cracks. Can be vitriolic (calling opponents “traitors” on TV), deviating from a purely measured genius model.                                                                                       | **3** – Openly advocates a new multipolar world to end U.S. hegemony[ndtv.com](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/brics-leaders-commit-to-building-democratic-multipolar-world-order-vladimir-putin-6867931#:~:text=BRICS%20countries%20are%20committed%20to,16th%20BRICS%20Summit%20in%20Kazan); building parallel institutions (with China, BRICS bank, etc.) – effectively pushing a revised world order.                                                                                                                                                           | **2** – Cultivated quasi-worship in Russia: state media praises him incessantly, loyalists venerate him (even iconography of him shirtless on a bear as meme).

France has a strong economy/tech base, though he doesn’t directly control world finance or Big Tech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **2** – Champions multilateralism and European unity; has attempted to mediate in conflicts (Russia-Ukraine pre-war talks, Iran deal outreach). Some success in rallying EU sanctions and coordination, but not a global coalition builder on the scale of a U.S. president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **2** – Seen as intellectual and articulate (a “measured” technocrat); admired by some as a youthful visionary, yet viewed by others as elitist. He lacks _universal_ charisma but can command a stage well.                                                                                        | **0** – No major comeback needed – he’s been consistently in power since 2017 (though he did form a new party overnight in 2016, which was a rapid rise rather than a return).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **2** – Generally poised and policy-smart, but has had missteps (e.g. handling of Yellow Vest protests) that show emotion or miscalculation. Usually calm and calculating on the world stage.                                                                                                                                 | **2** – Advocates for a stronger EU as a pole in global affairs, and “European Army” ideas – tweaking the world order rather than upending it. Speaks of a new architecture for European security and global climate agreements, aligning with a _reformed_ world system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **1** – Moderately popular at home at times, but also widely protested; internationally respected, not adored. No one is worshiping Macron as a messiah figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **2** – His almost out-of-nowhere rise from outsider to President at 39 was dramatic. Since then, he’s grown into a senior global statesman while still young, which some find intriguingly precocious (though not inexplicable given his savvy and circumstances).                                                                                                                                           | **18**    |   
| **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan** (President of Turkey)         | **1** – Limited connection: Turkey-Israel relations have fluctuated (recently restored ambassadors), but he has positioned himself as a champion of Palestinians more than a friend of Israel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **2** – Regional heavyweight straddling Europe and the Middle East; controls NATO’s 2nd-largest military. Influential in the Muslim world, though global clout is middling beyond his region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **1** – Oversees a large emerging economy (but struggling with inflation); Turkey has notable defense tech (drones) but he’s not a leader in global finance or cutting-edge tech outside his country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **2** – Tries to unite and lead the Muslim world’s causes (hosts summits on Jerusalem, leads the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation at times). Helped broker the Black Sea grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, showing peacemaker credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **2** – Firebrand populist with a devoted base; charismatic in Turkish political context (rousing speeches, Islamist and nationalist appeal). Viewed warily in the West due to his autocratic streak, but undeniably a skilled politician.                                                          | **3** – Survived a violent coup attempt in 2016 and emerged stronger[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/has-turkeys-attempted-coup-really-made-erdogan-stronger#:~:text=According%20to%20conventional%20wisdom%2C%20yes,to%20the%20soldiers%20last%20Friday), using it to purge opponents and expand powers – a literal political near-“death” and resurrection.                                                     | **1** – Often combative and emotive (e.g. scolding foreign leaders publicly); tactically shrewd but not always cool-headed. He has faced electoral setbacks and economic crises, showing chinks in the armor.                                                                                                                 | **2** – Calls for reforming the international system (famously “the world is bigger than five” at the UN, demanding more equitable power distribution). Positions Turkey as an independent pole – effectively pushing a modest new order where mid-sized powers have more say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **2** – Enjoys fervent support at home; many pious Turks hail him as the nation’s savior from secular corruption, and some pro-government media uses almost reverential language. Internationally, he’s not loved, but in parts of the Islamic world he’s admired as a bold leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **2** – From a poor Istanbul district and prison for reciting a poem, to dominating Turkey for 20 years – his trajectory is extraordinary. The post-coup crackdown and mysterious survival (some whisper he knew of the coup in advance) add aura to his story. Yet his ambitions and methods are fairly overt.                                                                                               | **18**    |   
| **Donald Trump** (Former US President)                 | **3** – Extremely strong Israel ties: moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Golan, and his Jewish son-in-law brokered multiple Israel-Arab peace deals (Abraham Accords)[timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kanye-west-says-jared-kushner-only-brokered-abraham-accords-to-make-money/#:~:text=Acclaimed%20rapper%20Kanye%20West%20said,%E2%80%9D).                                                                                                                                       | **2** – As 45th President and 2024 candidate, he remains a powerful figure commanding a large political movement; no formal power now but tremendous influence over one of two major US parties (and by extension global politics).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **1** – Wealthy businessman, but doesn’t control global financial or tech systems (he did initiate trade wars and deregulation, and started a social media platform, but these are limited impacts compared to central bankers or Big Tech moguls).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **2** – Achieved unprecedented ties between Israel and Arab states (UAE, Bahrain, etc.)[timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kanye-west-says-jared-kushner-only-brokered-abraham-accords-to-make-money/#:~:text=Acclaimed%20rapper%20Kanye%20West%20said,%E2%80%9D), arguably uniting former enemies. However, he also alienated many traditional U.S. allies. Still, the Middle East accords count as unification efforts under his watch.                                                                                                                                            | **2** – Charismatic **to his base** – millions find him blunt, funny, and relatable. To others he’s highly divisive. He commands rallies with cult-like fervor, but is reviled by opponents – a polarized charisma.                                                                                 | **2** – Suffered a clear political “death” in Jan 2021 (election loss) but refuses to exit the stage; indeed, he’s attempting an unprecedented comeback and remains the GOP frontrunner despite legal battles. His brand survived scandals that would end most careers.                                                                                                                                                                          | **0** – Far from measured: notoriously impulsive on Twitter, frequently touts his own “stable genius” but is prone to erratic policy swings and public rants. Not the calculated, never-flustered archetype by any means.                                                                                                     | **0** – Campaigned on _dismantling_ aspects of the existing world order (“globalists,” NATO burden-sharing) rather than building a new one. No one-world currency or global governance – he preferred national sovereignty and bilateral deals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **3** – Among his core supporters, he’s practically venerated. Some pastors anoint him as **chosen by God** (calling him an “anointed” instrument of divine will)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/god-gave-us-trump-christian-media-evangelicals-preach-messianic-message-2024-03-22/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20March%2022%20,fears%3A%20It%27s%20called%20the%20anointing), and MAGA crowds treat him as the only one who can “save America.” Merchandise and slogans border on devotional (e.g. “Trump prophecy” films, “Jesus is my Savior, Trump is my President”). | **2** – His rise in 2016 shocked the establishment, defying polls and precedent. He has since defied political gravity repeatedly (surviving impeachments, endless controversies). The persistence of his influence confounds critics, though it’s explainable via media savvy and a polarized base.                                                                                                          | **17**    |   
| **Klaus Schwab** (Founder, World Economic Forum)       | **1** – No special link to Israel aside from including Israeli delegations at Davos; background is German economist, not related to Middle East politics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **2** – Influential among global elites; convenes heads of state and CEOs. However, he holds no formal state power – influence is indirect (shaping agendas, not commanding armies).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **2** – Through WEF, influences trends in finance/tech (e.g. promotes AI, blockchain, ESG investing). Doesn’t _control_ these domains but often sets the conversation (e.g. his advocacy can push central bankers toward certain policies).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **2** – Literally brings together leaders from all continents in one forum; WEF is a platform for international cooperation (public-private partnerships on climate, health, etc.). Not a peacemaker in conflicts, but a unifier on global issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **1** – Seen as cerebral and polite. Not a charismatic icon to the public – if anything, he comes across as a behind-the-scenes professor. Elites listen to him; the average person might find him dry or even ominous in tone.                                                                     | **0** – No evident fall/revival. His career has been a steady accumulation of clout since founding WEF in 1971.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **2** – Always composed and forward-looking in interviews. He lays plans decades ahead (e.g. “Fourth Industrial Revolution”). He’s had critics (some initiatives fail), but he never publicly loses cool – a steady hand, if not infallible.                                                                                  | **3** – **Architect of the “Great Reset.”** He explicitly calls for **revamping “all aspects of our societies and economies”** in the post-COVID world[weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20a%20better%20outcome%2C,a%20%E2%80%9CGreat%20Reset%E2%80%9D%20of%20capitalism) – essentially a new global social contract. Promotes stakeholder capitalism and stronger global governance to address challenges.                                                                              | **0** – No mass following. In fact, many conspiracy theorists vilify him; he’s respected (or at least acknowledged) by business and political insiders, but there’s no grassroots fan club singing his praises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **2** – Much of his influence operates off-stage. To outsiders, it’s mysterious how a non-state actor wields so much sway. The WEF’s inner workings and his network of power can feel opaque, feeding theories about him as a “shadow ruler,” though those in the know see a savvy networker.                                                                                                                 | **16**    |   
| **Christine Lagarde** (President, ECB)                 | **1** – No notable Israel connection (French by origin; as IMF chief and ECB head she dealt with Israel as one of many member states, nothing personal).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **3** – One of the world’s top financial decision-makers (led the IMF, now the European Central Bank). Her policies affect the eurozone and by extension the global economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **3** – Oversees the euro (common currency of 20+ nations) and is spearheading a **digital euro project**[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/ecbs-lagarde-urges-eu-lawmakers-speed-up-digital-euro-law-2025-06-23/#:~:text=Lagarde%20renewed%20her%20plea%20in,digital%20currencies%20known%20as%20stablecoins). Directly shapes monetary policy for trillions in GDP and is at the forefront of digital currency innovation. | **1** – Coordinates with finance ministers and central bankers globally; helped unify EU responses during crises (Eurozone debt crisis, COVID recovery). Not a diplomatic unifier for peace, but for economic stability she pushes coordination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **2** – Highly respected for her intellect and polished demeanor. Communicates complex ideas clearly; known for elegance and calm under pressure. Not “beloved” by masses but has an image of competent leadership that inspires confidence.                                                        | **0** – No dramatic rise-fall cycle. Apart from a minor legal issue (found negligent in a French arbitration case but given no penalty), her career trajectory has been consistently upward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **3** – Extremely measured in public remarks (crucial for central bankers to avoid market panic). Renowned for steady, no-drama crisis management – she helped steer Europe through financial storms with grace.                                                                                                              | **2** – Advocates reforming the global financial system (e.g. making it greener, more inclusive) and embraces new paradigms like cryptocurrency regulation. Supports **globally aligned financial rules** and multilateral solutions, aligning with the idea of a tuned-up world system rather than radical change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **0** – Hardly a cult figure. She’s respected and sometimes admired, especially by women in law and finance as a trailblazer, but the public doesn’t idolize central bankers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **1** – Broke barriers (first woman to head IMF and ECB) through visible merit and networking. Her power is institutional and transparent. There’s little mystique – she operates in well-known forums, though the average person might not realize how much her decisions impact their daily life.                                                                                                           | **16**    |   
| **Pope Francis** (Leader of Catholic Church)           | **2** – Maintains strong relations with Israel and the Jewish people in a religious context (e.g. visiting Jerusalem, praying at the Western Wall). No Jewish heritage, but as Pope he has a unique bond with the Holy Land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **2** – Moral and spiritual influence over ~1.3 billion Catholics worldwide; a global figure who can move public opinion on issues like climate change and refugees. Lacks temporal power, but his encyclicals and speeches shape countless local actions and even some policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **0** – Does not control economics or tech (aside from the Vatican’s own finances). He can _urge_ ethical use of technology or equitable economics, but holds no direct levers in those domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **3** – Actively works to unite people across faiths and nations. He brokered the **Cuba–US thaw in 2014** behind the scenes, and famously signed a **historic fraternity pact with a Grand Imam** to promote interreligious peace[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/pope-and-grand-imam-sign-historic-pledge-of-fraternity-in-uae#:~:text=The%20pope%20and%20the%20grand,Islam%2C%20Judaism%20and%20other%20faiths). Constantly calls for multilateral peace efforts (e.g. in Syria, South Sudan).                                                                   | **2** – Globally admired for humility and compassion. His personal warmth and simple style made him very popular, especially early in his papacy (the “Francis effect”). Not universally praised by all (he has critics in the Church), but many see him as a genuinely kind, intelligent shepherd. | **0** – No personal “death and comeback.” His papacy has been continuous; any crises (like curial opposition) haven’t removed him from his role. (Notably, his immediate predecessor resigned, but Francis himself has not fallen from grace in such a way.)                                                                                                                                                                                     | **2** – Almost always gentle, composed, and smiling in public. Handles tough questions with empathy. However, he can be candid and has had a few off-script comments that caused turbulence, showing he’s human. Overall, a steady and strategic leader who has navigated Church politics adeptly.                            | **2** – Advocates for a new way of worldly living – a more just economy, care for creation, and global fraternity. He’s pushed the concept of a “new humanism” and endorsed global frameworks (like the Paris Climate Accord). Some accuse him of pushing for a kind of _“new world order”_ of solidarity (in a benevolent sense)[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/pope-and-grand-imam-sign-historic-pledge-of-fraternity-in-uae#:~:text=The%20pope%20and%20the%20grand,Islam%2C%20Judaism%20and%20other%20faiths).                   | **2** – Many faithful treat him with great reverence (as the successor of St. Peter). He is often welcomed by adoring crowds on travels. While Catholics don’t _worship_ the Pope (they venerate the office), the level of admiration can approach reverence – he’s been called a potential “savior” of a ailing Church by supporters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **1** – His election was surprising (first Jesuit, first from the Americas) and he has a habit of springing surprises (like spontaneous phone calls to ordinary people). But there’s no secret cabal or unexplained leap in power – he was a cardinal elected in a conclave. His “mystery” is more in his persona: a simple man now wielding vast soft power, catching the world off-guard with humility.     | **15**    |   
| **Larry Fink** (CEO of BlackRock)                      | **1** – Jewish heritage, but Israel is not a focus of his public work (aside from investment opportunities).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **3** – As head of BlackRock (the world’s largest asset manager), he oversees **$10 trillion** in investments. He can influence nearly every major corporation and government debt – a behind-the-curtain power in global markets[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/ecbs-lagarde-urges-eu-lawmakers-speed-up-digital-euro-law-2025-06-23/#:~:text=The%20ECB%20has%20been%20working,proven%20elusive%20amid%20%20101)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/ecbs-lagarde-urges-eu-lawmakers-speed-up-digital-euro-law-2025-06-23/#:~:text=privately%20issued%20digital%20currencies%20known,as%20stablecoins). | **3** – Through BlackRock’s holdings, exerts control/pressure on finance and indirectly on tech (major shareholder in Big Tech firms). His annual letters effectively set ESG and corporate governance trends. Few individuals have more sway over capital flows.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **0** – Not a diplomatic figure; doesn’t broker peace or alliances. His realm of “uniting” is convening investors or advocating public-private cooperation on climate, which is influence but not nation-uniting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **1** – Highly respected in finance for his acumen, but essentially unknown to the general public until recently. Not a charismatic public speaker – comes across as a typical CEO.                                                                                                                 | **0** – No notable personal fall or comeback. His trajectory has been one of steady expansion of BlackRock from nothing to colossus since 1988, with him at the helm throughout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **2** – Very prudent and methodical. He speaks in measured tones about long-term risks (climate, etc.) and doesn’t do drama. He has occasionally been caught in controversy (critics from left and right on his ESG stance), but he navigates these calmly, adjusting strategy without public meltdowns.                      | **3** – **Advocates “stakeholder capitalism”** and a reshaping of capitalism’s foundations – essentially aligning with the WEF-style _reset_ thinking[weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20a%20better%20outcome%2C,a%20%E2%80%9CGreat%20Reset%E2%80%9D%20of%20capitalism). He pushes companies to serve social and environmental goals, effectively nudging a new system where private capital drives global policy in lieu of slow governments.                                          | **0** – No public adulation; if anything he’s recently demonized by both sides (some call him a “woke capitalist” forcing agendas, others say he’s not doing enough). Certainly no one is putting his picture on posters to cheer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **2** – His influence is vast yet mostly invisible to ordinary people. The idea that one man’s firm can own so much of the world’s assets feels almost conspiratorial. He operates in high finance shadows, which creates an aura for those given to speculation – though in reality he’s quite public via his letters.                                                                                       | **15**    |   
| **Jared Kushner** (Former Sr. Advisor, USA)            | **3** – Orthodox Jew, close family friend of Netanyahu; **architect of the Abraham Accords** that normalized Israel’s relations with multiple Arab states[timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kanye-west-says-jared-kushner-only-brokered-abraham-accords-to-make-money/#:~:text=Acclaimed%20rapper%20Kanye%20West%20said,%E2%80%9D). Personal ties to Israel don’t get much more direct.                                                                                                            | **1** – Not in office now; influence is mostly behind the scenes. (During 2017–2020 he had significant White House power. Currently runs an investment fund with Gulf partners, maintaining Middle East clout.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **1** – Some influence via his Affinity Partners fund (backed by $2B from Saudi’s MBS[timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kanye-west-says-jared-kushner-only-brokered-abraham-accords-to-make-money/#:~:text=Kushner%20has%20come%20under%20scrutiny,while%20Trump%20was%20in%20office)), but he’s no industry titan. His wealth is large but not system-shaking; no direct role in tech or central banking.                                               | **3** – Instrumental in uniting old enemies: brokered peace deals between Israel and UAE, Bahrain, etc., creating a new regional bloc of cooperation[timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kanye-west-says-jared-kushner-only-brokered-abraham-accords-to-make-money/#:~:text=Acclaimed%20rapper%20Kanye%20West%20said,%E2%80%9D). Also pushed a shared Arab-Israeli-U.S. vision (even if Palestinians were left out).                                                                                                                                                                  | **1** – Soft-spoken and media-shy. Viewed as capable and intelligent in negotiations, but not someone who inspires crowds. He wielded influence through access and intellect, not charisma.                                                                                                         | **0** – His “fall” was the end of the Trump administration. He quietly exited government, which was a loss of power but not a scandal-driven fall. Since then, no dramatic rebound – though if he facilitated future Saudi-Israel peace or returns in a new administration, that could count as a resurrection. As of now, no.                                                                                                                   | **2** – Known for being **extremely calm and strategic** under pressure – e.g., managing multiple portfolios (Middle East, criminal justice reform) without public drama. He _never_ lashed out in media and stayed deliberately low-profile, which in hindsight made him surprisingly effective.                             | **1** – Talks about improving the Middle East economic order (his peace plan had grand economic visions) but not about global governance. Supports globalization (invests Gulf money abroad) and is aligned with globalist business circles, yet there’s no doctrine from him on remaking world systems writ large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **0** – Not a figure of public admiration. If anything, he’s viewed with suspicion by many (some saw him as nepotistic, others now question his Saudi ties). No popular following beyond perhaps respect in certain diplomatic/business circles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **2** – How did an untested 36-year-old end up negotiating Middle East peace? His meteoric entry into geopolitics was stunning. Many doubted him, yet he succeeded in areas veterans failed. There’s an element of intrigue in how he quietly pulled off the Abraham Accords and then secured billions from the Gulf – an uncanny knack for being in the right place, making the right deals.                 | **14**    |   
| **Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO of Meta)                      | **0** – No notable connection to Israel (aside from having Israeli users/employees). Background is American, with no direct Israeli or Jewish heritage (he’s _not_ Jewish – **Correction**: _Zuckerberg **is** Jewish by heritage, but he hasn’t leveraged that in any Israel-relations context_).                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **3** – Founder of Facebook, which connects ~3 billion people; his decisions on algorithms literally affect global information flow and political discourse. That’s significant soft power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **3** – **Directly controls major social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)** and thus has a hand in advertising, news dissemination, and even digital commerce worldwide. Attempted to launch a global digital currency (Libra/Diem), showing ambition to influence finance too.                                                                                                                                                                          | **0** – Does not engage in uniting countries or diplomacy. If anything, Facebook has been a tool both for unity and division, but Zuckerberg himself isn’t brokering peace treaties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **1** – Highly intelligent in tech/business, but _famously_ awkward in public. Not someone people find magnetic personally – he’s often likened to a robot in demeanor.                                                                                                                             | **1** – Weathered huge scandals (privacy breaches, election meddling uproar). Facebook’s reputation “died” for a while, but he rebranded to Meta and pivoted to new horizons (metaverse) – a form of corporate resurrection. He remains at the helm, and the core business still prints money.                                                                                                                                                   | **2** – Generally very controlled in interviews and hearings (if a bit stiff). He rarely shows anger, even under hostile questioning. He plans long-term (poured billions into metaverse despite criticism). However, strategic misreads (like underestimating backlash or pivoting too hard to VR) show he’s not unbeatable. | **2** – Aims to **“connect the whole world”** – essentially a global community via technology. Promotes concepts like a **metaverse society**, and once envisioned Libra coin to transform global finance. These are pieces of a potential new digital order, albeit led by a private company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **0** – While billions use his platforms, _he_ is not loved. If anything, users distrust him (think he violated privacy or say “#DeleteFacebook”). No fan clubs for Mark; he doesn’t have admirers in the way Musk or Jobs did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **2** – His rise was quick (from Harvard dorm to controlling a global communication empire by his early 20s). That a single college kid’s project became so entwined with world events is a bit surreal. His continued dominance despite calls for his ouster and regulatory threats sometimes baffles observers – but it’s explained by his majority voting control and relentless focus on expansion.       | **14**    |   
| **Yuval Noah Harari** (Author/Futurist)                | **3** – Israeli public intellectual; born, raised, and teaches in Israel. Deep personal and cultural ties to the country (though he’s a critic of some policies, his identity is Israeli-Jewish).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **2** – Influences many world leaders and tech CEOs through his writings. His books _Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_ are read by the global elite; he’s a fixture at places like Davos. As a thought leader, his ideas shape how power players envision the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **0** – Holds no office or corporate power; doesn’t direct any economy or technology – he analyzes and predicts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **0** – Not involved in any political or diplomatic unity efforts. He _does_ argue humanity should unite against common threats (AI, climate, etc.), but that’s advocacy, not implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **2** – Celebrated as a brilliant thinker. He’s articulate, often comes across as wise and Zen-like. People respect his intellect greatly, though he’s not a classic charismatic firebrand – more a soft-spoken sage.                                                                               | **0** – No “rise-fall-rise” story. He became famous through publishing success; he hasn’t been “cancelled” or disgraced and then come back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **2** – In interviews and speeches he is unfailingly calm, wry, and insightful. He tackles tough questions about AI or religion without fluster. He certainly appears like a measured genius, though being an academic, he’s had few high-stakes _tests_ of composure in the public arena.                                    | **3** – Advocates openly for a **new global paradigm**. He talks about humans transcending biology, the merger of info-tech and biotech, data replacing religion. He’s essentially sketching a blueprint for a new world (even warning about “data-ism” as a new religion[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/pope-and-grand-imam-sign-historic-pledge-of-fraternity-in-uae#:~:text=The%20pope%20and%20the%20grand,Islam%2C%20Judaism%20and%20other%20faiths)). Also a big supporter of global governance to handle technological risks. | **0** – Has admirers of his work, but no one prays to Harari. In fact, religious conservatives _attack_ him for his statements (he’s been villainized by some as promoting a godless future). He’s respected and maybe even revered intellectually, but not loved in a personal or emotional sense by masses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **1** – His sudden global fame from being an obscure history professor is a bit mysterious. Why _him_ among millions of academics? It makes sense (he’s a great storyteller and thinker, and got endorsement from folks like Obama and Zuckerberg), but it happened quickly. Beyond that, he doesn’t hold power – he _influences_ those with power, which is a shadowy kind of clout that’s hard to quantify. | **13**    |   
| **António Guterres** (UN Secretary-General)            | **1** – No personal link, but constantly engages with Israel-Palestine as part of UN duties (e.g. appealing for ceasefires). His stance is neutral/diplomatic, not born of heritage or alliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **2** – As UN chief, he’s the world’s top diplomat. Able to convene 193 nations, set global agendas (climate, SDGs). But his influence depends on great powers’ cooperation; he can’t force their hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **0** – Does not control any economy or tech platform. He relies on moral authority and convening power, not command over resources or tech development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **3** – **Uniter of nations by job description.** Brokers international agreements (he was pivotal in the 2015 Paris Climate Accord negotiations as he came into office, and in pushing COVID vaccine cooperation). Frequently urges multilateral solutions and has negotiated humanitarian pauses in conflicts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **1** – Known as a pragmatist and polite consensus-builder. Not particularly charismatic to the global public – many wouldn’t recognize him on the street. But within diplomatic circles he’s respected for his calm, fatherly demeanor and experience (former Portuguese PM).                      | **0** – No notable fall – he smoothly transitioned from national politics to UN posts. No “comeback” storyline; it’s been steady service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **2** – Unfailingly diplomatic and composed, even amid global crises. Manages heated Security Council meetings with courtesy. He’s had frustrations (limited success in e.g. Syria peace), but never loses his temper in public; always sticks to reasoned pleas.                                                             | **2** – Calls for a **“networked, inclusive multilateralism”** – essentially reforming the UN and global governance to be more effective and equitable. Supports things like a global climate fund, worldwide digital cooperation roadmaps. It’s an evolution of the current system (not a one-man rule), but absolutely pushing for a stronger, unified world response to challenges.                                                                                                                                                                              | **0** – Hardly anyone outside the UN fanbase “worships” him. He’s respected, and perhaps people in his homeland take pride in him, but he’s not got a popular following. If anything, activists get angry at the UN for being slow – few look at the SG as a savior figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **1** – Standard career politician-turned-diplomat. There’s little mysterious about him; he’s very transparent in his earnest beliefs. The limitations of his power (needing Security Council consensus) are well-known, so nothing inexplicable there. He does quietly shuttle diplomacy, but those efforts usually surface in press when successful.                                                        | **13**    |
