BC you know so the Great Sphinx which comes from about 2500 or so BC maybe 2600 BC think about how old that's 4600 years old That's just it's hard to believe right in any event this Stella right here was added at sometime in the 1400s BC about say 11 hundred years later Again it's about 12 foot tall it's right there between the paws of the Sphinx we think it comes from about 1424 BC all right it tells King Tutmos the fourth again not the first born son of the Exodus Pharaoh but another son on a hunting trip then resting by the Sphinx and having a vision or a dream what did this vision or dream tell him it said that if he cleared the sand from the Sphinx the throne would be his The throne would be his if he clears the sand from the Sphinx why would he need to do this why would he even need to put this inscription up do you see the implication here that Sphinx itself was built around 2500 BC That snow of the dream Stella was put in in 1424 BC when was the Exodus 1446 BC who was the Pharaoh Ammon Hotep the Second Ammon Hotep the second himself was not the first born somehow he got to the throne he wasn't the first born so when the tenth plague came in he didn't die because he was not the first born but he had a son who was the first born and vanishes from Egyptian history we don't know what happened to him that's why is Mito just said it Stella up in order to give him legitimacy to make him a legitimate ruler of Egypt so this is circumstantial evidence that I'm in hotep the second is the fairer of the exodus his first born son has been killed in the plague his second born son said oh now I have the the throne and I'm going to say that Ra gave me a dream that authenticated my claim to the throne and that's what that dream Stella is saying
