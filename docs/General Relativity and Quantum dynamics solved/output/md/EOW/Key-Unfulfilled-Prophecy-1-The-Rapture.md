**Key Unfulfilled Prophecy #1: The Rapture**   
   
The Rapture describes the resurrection of Christians who have died in the past, and those who are alive at the time of its occurrence. Even though the word rapture does not appear in the Bible, it derives from the Latin word _rapere_ which means to be caught up.  Christians who are alive will be translated from mortal bodies to immortal bodies and all will rise to meet Jesus Christ in the air. Unbelievers will be left to go through the Tribulation period.  This event will occur before the Tribulation period, can happen at any time and will actually initiate the beginning of the Tribulation. Scriptures that support the fact of its occurrence are:   
   
**1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 (KJV)**     
16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:     
17  Then we which are alive _and_ remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.     
18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.   
   
**John 14:1-3 (KJV)**     
1  Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.     
2 In my Father’s house are many mansions: if _it were_ not _so_, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.     
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, _there_ ye may be also.   
   
**Luke 21:34 (KJV)**     
34  And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and _so_ that day come upon you unawares.   
   
**1 Corinthians 15:23 (KJV)**     
23  But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.   
   
**1 Corinthians 15:51-52 (KJV)**     
51  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,     
52  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.   
   
**2 Corinthians 5:1 (KJV)**     
1  For we know that if our earthly house of _this_ tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.   
   
**Colossians 3:4 (KJV)**     
4  When Christ, _who is_ our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.   
   
**James 5:7-8 (KJV)**     
7  Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.     
8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.   
   
**1 John 2:28 (KJV)**     
28  And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.   
   
Be encouraged Saints of God because Jesus is soon to come.  Let us all be found busy winning souls for the Lord.  Let’s keep our garments white—without spot or wrinkle—and our lamps trimmed and burning, for the Rapture could occur at any time.
