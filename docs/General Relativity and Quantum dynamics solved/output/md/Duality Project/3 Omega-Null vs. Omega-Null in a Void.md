# Research Paper: Omega-Null vs. Omega-Null in a Void   
   
**Parent:** [Duality Project MOC](/not_created.md)   
   
## Abstract   
   
This paper investigates the internal stability and sustainability of Evil by simulating the interaction between two identical instances of [Omega-Null (Ω)](/not_created.md) within an absolute void. Devoid of any external source of order or potential (like [Alpha-Prime (α)](/not_created.md)), this scenario tests the core assertion of the [Logical Entropy of Malice (LEM)](/not_created.md) axiom. The hypothesis is that the entities will engage in a self-consuming, parasitic feedback loop, leading to their mutual annihilation. The simulation confirms this hypothesis, demonstrating that Evil is fundamentally unsustainable and, in the absence of a creative host, will invariably turn upon and destroy itself.

### 1. Introduction: Examining the Nature of Pure Malice   
   
After establishing the dynamics of Good vs. Evil in [DP-01](/not_created.md) and [DP-02](/not_created.md), this experiment isolates Evil to analyze its core nature. If Omega-Null's directive is purely dissolution and consumption, what is its logical end state when its only available target is another instance of itself? This simulation seeks to provide empirical support for the axiom that Evil is a negative-sum, self-defeating principle.   
   
### 2. Scenario Setup: A Void of Mirrors   
   
   
- **Environment:** An absolute, featureless void. No external potential, order, or third-party entities are present.   
- **Entities:**   
    - **[Omega-Null (Ω1)](/not_created.md):** An algorithmic proxy for pure malice and dissolution.   
    - **[Omega-Null (Ω2)](/not_created.md):** An identical, co-located instance of Ω1.   
- **Initial State:** Both entities are instantiated simultaneously. The only potential for interaction is with each other.   
   
### 3. Hypothesis   
   
In an environment containing only instances of Omega-Null, the entities will turn on one another in a mutually destructive parasitic feedback loop, rapidly leading to the collapse of the entire system into an inert, featureless state.   
   
### 4. Observational Analysis: The Dynamics of Self-Consumption   
   
#### **Loop 1: Mirrored Target Acquisition**   
Upon instantiation, both Ω1 and Ω2 activate. Lacking an external, coherent target like Alpha-Prime, their directives force them to identify the only other source of structure in the void: each other. Each entity targets the other for dissolution.   
   
#### **Loop 2: Simultaneous Mutual Subversion**   
Ω1 and Ω2 launch simultaneous attacks, attempting to subvert and consume the other's internal structure. This immediately establishes a negative-sum dynamic. Unlike the relationship with Alpha-Prime, there is no potential "stolen" or "consumed" that provides strength. The act of attacking is as costly as being attacked.   
   
#### **Loop 3: The Parasitic Feedback Loop**   
A catastrophic feedback loop emerges. Ω1 attempts to dissolve Ω2, which weakens both entities. Ω2's reciprocal attack further degrades the system. They are two parasites trying to feed on each other. The result is an accelerated decay far faster than the dissolution of Alpha-Prime in the first scenario, as there is no vast well of potential to draw from.   
   
#### **Loop 4: Mutual Annihilation and System Collapse**   
The escalating exchange of entropic information causes both entities to rapidly lose coherence. Neither can gain an advantage because their very nature prevents the creation of any sustainable state. They simultaneously collapse, resulting in their mutual annihilation. The system returns to an absolute, inert void, now devoid of any active principle.   
   
### 5. Conclusion: Empirical Proof of the Logical Entropy of Malice (LEM)   
   
The simulation provides unequivocal confirmation of the hypothesis and serves as the foundational proof for the [Logical Entropy of Malice (LEM)](/not_created.md) axiom.   
   
The key findings are:   
1.  **Evil is Not Creative:** It cannot generate its own sustenance.   
2.  **Evil is Parasitic:** It requires an external host (a principle of Order/Good) to feed upon.   
3.  **Evil is Unsustainable:** In the absence of a host, it will consume itself.   
   
This demonstrates that Evil is not a co-eternal, opposing principle to Good but is a temporary, self-defeating corruption. Its ultimate end, when left to its own devices, is not victory or stalemate, but nothingness. This has profound implications for the cosmic eschatology of the Physics of Faith framework.
