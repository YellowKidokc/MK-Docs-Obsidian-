6. Network Theory & Systems Dynamics   
Key Concepts:   
   
Interconnectedness: The impact of individual nodes (people) grows when part of a connected network.   
Exponential Amplification: Relationships can exponentially enhance the overall system's coherence.   
Integration:   
   
The Faith Network Function    
𝑅   
(   
𝐹

𝐿

This term models the idea that collective faith (e.g., communal prayer) produces effects far greater than isolated acts.
