When very high-energy virtual particle pairs appear near massive objects or high-curvature regions, general relativity predicts significant gravitational redshifting effects on these particles. However, quantum field theory typically ignores these gravitational effects on vacuum fluctuations, creating an inconsistency in how we understand their behavior in strong gravitational fields.
