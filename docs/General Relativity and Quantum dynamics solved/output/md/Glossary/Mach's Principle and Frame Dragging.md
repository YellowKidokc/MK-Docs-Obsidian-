**Textbook Definition:** Mach's Principle suggests that the inertial properties of matter (resistance to acceleration) arise from the influence of all other matter in the universe. Frame dragging is a related relativistic effect where a massive rotating object drags spacetime around with it, influencing the motion of nearby objects. These concepts connect to both quantum and relativistic physics but are treated differently in each framework.   
   
**Simplified for Glossary:** Mach's Principle proposes that a body's resistance to motion is determined by all other matter in the universe. In general relativity, this manifests as "frame dragging" where spinning masses twist spacetime, while quantum physics approaches this global connection differently.   
   
For our incompatibility framework, I would suggest starting with the concepts that most directly highlight the contradictions between quantum mechanics and general relativity. Based on your desire to begin with the most challenging concepts, I would recommend starting with:   
   
1. The Quantum Field Theory Vacuum Energy problem (the cosmological constant problem)   
2. Bell's Inequality and how it conflicts with relativistic locality   
3. Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment and its implications for causality in spacetime   
   
Would you like me to expand on how these three concepts specifically demonstrate the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity? Or would you prefer I cover all of them more briefly in relation to our framework?
