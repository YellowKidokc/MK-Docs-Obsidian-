**Textbook Definition:** The Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems are a set of mathematical proofs developed by Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking in the 1960s that demonstrate the inevitability of spacetime singularities (points where gravity becomes infinitely strong and spacetime curvature becomes infinite) under general relativity given certain reasonable physical conditions. These theorems show that general relativity predicts its own breakdown in regions like the centers of black holes and the beginning of the universe.   
   
**Simplified for Glossary:** Mathematical proofs showing that general relativity inevitably predicts infinities (singularities) in certain situations like black holes and the Big Bang, indicating where the theory breaks down and quantum effects must become important.
