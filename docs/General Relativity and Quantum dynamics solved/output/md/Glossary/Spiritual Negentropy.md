🌟 Spiritual Negentropy: The Force That Restores Order to the Soul   
Spiritual negentropy is the opposite of spiritual decay (entropy)—it is the force that brings healing, order, and renewal to our spiritual lives.   
   
In science, negentropy (or negative entropy) means things are becoming more organized and full of life instead of breaking down. In a spiritual sense, negentropy is what restores meaning, purpose, and connection when life feels chaotic.   
   
🌀 Understanding Entropy vs. Negentropy   
Entropy = Things naturally fall apart over time (disorder).   
Negentropy = The energy that rebuilds and restores order.   
👉 Example in Physics:   
   
A hot cup of coffee cools down (entropy increases).   
If you reheat it, you reverse entropy (negentropy).   
👉 Example in Spirituality:   
   
A person who loses faith may feel empty, lost, and disconnected (spiritual entropy).   
Through prayer, love, and purpose, they find renewal and joy (spiritual negentropy).   
🔆 What Causes Spiritual Entropy?   
Spiritual entropy happens when we disconnect from meaning, truth, and higher purpose. This can be caused by:   
✅ Sin and moral confusion – Choosing destructive actions.   
✅ Lack of faith or purpose – Feeling lost in life.   
✅ Negativity and hopelessness – Losing sight of goodness.   
✅ Isolation – Cutting off deep connections with others and the universe.   
   
👉 Example: Imagine a tree that stops getting sunlight and water. Over time, it dries up and dies (entropy).
