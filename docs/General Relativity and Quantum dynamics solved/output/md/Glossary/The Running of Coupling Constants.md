Quantum field theory shows that the strength of fundamental forces changes with energy scale (a phenomenon called "running coupling constants"). Extrapolation suggests these forces might converge to equal strength near the Planck scaleâ€”potentially indicating a unified theory exists at that scale. However, conventional extrapolation methods become unreliable precisely where we need them most, near the Planck energy.
