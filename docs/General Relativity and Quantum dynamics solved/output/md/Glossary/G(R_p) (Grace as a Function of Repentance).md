4️⃣ G(Rₚ) (Grace as a Function of Repentance)   
👉 Grace is the force that brings restoration, and its strength depends on repentance (Rₚ).   
✅ More repentance = more grace (exponential increase).   
✅ More sin = weaker grace effect (grace is blocked).   
   
Example: If you clean up a messy room (repentance), grace works like a self-cleaning power that makes it even better than before!
