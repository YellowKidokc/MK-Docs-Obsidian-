Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, when applied to spacetime itself, implies that at Planck scales, the very geometry of space becomes uncertain. This directly contradicts general relativity's requirement for a well-defined, deterministic spacetime manifold.   
   
We can see this through dimensional analysis: The uncertainty principle (ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2) combined with the relativistic relationship between energy and gravitational effects gives us the Planck length (√(ħG/c³)) below which space itself cannot be measured without creating a black hole.
