Quantum field theory tells us that vacuum fluctuations—temporary appearances of particles and fields—grow dramatically stronger as we examine smaller distances. By the time we reach the Planck scale, these quantum fluctuations would be so energetic that they would significantly distort spacetime itself.   
   
The energy density of these fluctuations would become so immense that, according to general relativity, they should collapse into microscopic black holes. However, these fluctuations happen continuously and everywhere—meaning spacetime would be constantly creating and destroying tiny black holes, making the very concept of a smooth spacetime manifold meaningless.
