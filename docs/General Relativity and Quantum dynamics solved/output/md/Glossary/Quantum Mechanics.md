**Definition:** A fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics incorporates the dual wave-particle nature of matter, uncertainty principle, and probabilistic interpretations of physical phenomena.   
   
**Design Philosophy:**   
   
   
- **Color Choice:** The blue-purple palette represents the mysterious, non-intuitive nature of quantum phenomena   
- **Central Atom Structure:** Symbolizes the fundamental building blocks of reality while the electron orbits suggest both particle and wave properties   
- **Uncertainty Visualization:** The opposing wave patterns at the bottom represent Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - as one property becomes more certain, the other necessarily becomes less certain   
- **Scripture Connection:** "For now we see through a glass, darkly" acknowledges how quantum mechanics reveals that reality at its foundation is more mysterious than our everyday experience suggests   
   
**Key Concepts:**   
   
   
- **Uncertainty Principle:** The fundamental limit to the precision with which complementary variables can be known (e.g., position and momentum)   
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they're observed   
- **Quantum Entanglement:** When particles become linked, their quantum states remain connected regardless of distance   
- **Observer Effect:** The act of measurement unavoidably affects what is being measured   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
Quantum Mechanics - Showing fundamental principles like uncertainty, wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, and observer effect with atomic structure visuals   
   
ðŸ”¹ How is Quantum Mechanics Different?   
In everyday life, things behave in predictable ways.   
âœ… A ball rolls when you push it.   
âœ… A car moves when you hit the gas.   
âœ… A planet orbits because of gravity.   
   
But in the quantum world, tiny particles act unpredictably.
