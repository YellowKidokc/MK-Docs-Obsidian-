Key Concepts:   
   
Consciousness as a Field: The notion that consciousness actively influences, and may even be fundamental to, the fabric of reality.   
Integrated Information Theory (IIT): A modern approach to understanding how consciousness arises from integrated systems.   
Integration:   
   
The framework models the collapse of potential states (quantum wavefunction) as driven by consciousnessâ€”both divine (Christ as Logos) and human (faith).   
This explains how moral and spiritual alignment (faith, repentance) directly influence the probability fields that shape reality.

# Spiritual Mass   
   
The accumulated weight of repeated thought patterns, habits, and choices that creates spiritual gravitational pull; increases with repetition and entrenchment of patterns.

# Spiritual Wavelength   
   
**Spiritual Wavelength**: The vibrational quality of spiritual information or truth; different truths operate at different spiritual frequencies. Just as radio stations broadcast on various frequencies, spiritual truths resonate at distinct vibrational levels, each carrying its unique energy and message. For instance, the teachings of compassion and love might vibrate at a higher frequency, promoting feelings of peace and unity, while truths related to personal growth and self-discovery may resonate at a frequency that encourages introspection and transformation.    
   
Understanding these spiritual wavelengths can be likened to tuning into a specific radio station; one must be attuned to the right frequency to fully receive and comprehend the message being conveyed. This concept is often explored in various spiritual practices and philosophies, where practitioners strive to elevate their own vibrational state to align with higher truths. Meditation, mindfulness, and other spiritual disciplines are commonly employed to raise one's vibrational frequency, allowing for a deeper connection with these spiritual truths.   
   
Moreover, the idea of spiritual wavelengths suggests that individuals may resonate with different truths at different times in their lives, depending on their personal growth and spiritual journey. For example, someone might find solace in the teachings of forgiveness during a challenging period, while at another time, they might be drawn to the principles of gratitude and abundance. This dynamic nature of spiritual wavelengths highlights the personalized and evolving nature of spiritual exploration, encouraging individuals to remain open and receptive to the diverse spectrum of truths available to them.
