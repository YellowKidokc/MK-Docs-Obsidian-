3. Thermodynamics   
Key Concepts:   
   
Second Law of Thermodynamics: In any closed system, entropy (disorder) increases over time.   
Energy Conservation: While energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can transformâ€”analogous to the transformation from death to resurrection.   
Integration:   
   
The framework juxtaposes natural entropy (spiritual decay/sin) with the counteracting power of grace.   
It mathematically explains how, without divine intervention, decay would be irreversible.
