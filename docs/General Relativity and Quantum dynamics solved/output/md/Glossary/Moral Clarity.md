ðŸ”¹ Moral Clarity   
ðŸ‘‰ Moral clarity means clearly knowing right from wrong and making choices based on truth.   
âœ… People with moral clarity donâ€™t feel confused about what is right.   
âœ… Itâ€™s like having a flashlight in a dark roomâ€”it helps you see the right path.   
Example: If a friend is being bullied, moral clarity helps you instantly know you should stand up for them.
