🎲 Quantum Possibilities: The Strange World of Probability   
Unlike normal physics, where things happen predictably, quantum mechanics is all about probabilities.   
   
🔹 How Do We Know What Will Happen?   
✅ We don’t! In quantum mechanics, we can only predict the chance of something happening.   
✅ Instead of saying, “The electron is here,” we say, “The electron has a 60% chance of being here.”   
   
👉 Until we measure a particle, it exists in all possible states at once—this is called the wave function.
