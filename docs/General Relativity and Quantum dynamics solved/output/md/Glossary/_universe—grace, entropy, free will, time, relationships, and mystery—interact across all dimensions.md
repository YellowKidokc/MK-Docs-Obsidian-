📌 Spiritual Principle, Scientific Truth, and Theological Revelation   
💡 Definition: These three represent the layers of reality—the intersection where science, spirituality, and divine revelation meet.   
   
1️⃣ Scientific Meaning:   
   
A scientific truth is a principle verified through observation and experiment (e.g., gravity, entropy, quantum mechanics).   
A spiritual principle is a law governing human experience and consciousness (e.g., love, faith, sin, redemption).   
A theological revelation is truth given by God, often transcending human discovery (e.g., salvation, resurrection, grace).   
2️⃣ Jesus and This Concept:   
   
Science discovers how things work.   
Spiritual principles show how we should live.   
Theology reveals why everything exists.   
✨ Jesus is the bridge between all three: “I am the Way (spiritual), the Truth (scientific), and the Life (theological).” — John 14:6   
3️⃣ Why They Mirror Each Other:   
   
In physics: Light has a wave-particle duality.   
In theology: Jesus has a divine-human duality.   
In both: Truth is multi-layered—requiring deeper understanding.
