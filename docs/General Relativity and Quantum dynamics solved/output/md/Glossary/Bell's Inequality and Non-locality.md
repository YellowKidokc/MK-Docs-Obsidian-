**Textbook Definition:** Bell's Inequality is a mathematical inequality that places constraints on the correlations that can exist between the properties of particles according to any physical theory based on local hidden variables. Quantum mechanics violates Bell's Inequality, demonstrating that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. This violation suggests that reality is fundamentally non-local, meaning that particles can instantaneously influence each other regardless of distance.   
   
**Simplified for Glossary:** A mathematical test that proves quantum particles can influence each other faster than light could travel between them, violating a fundamental assumption of general relativity.
