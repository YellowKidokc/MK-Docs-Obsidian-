When physicists attempt to calculate quantum field effects at these scales, they encounter persistent infinities in their equations. These aren't just computational challengesâ€”they signal a fundamental breakdown in the applicability of our theories.   
   
For example, when trying to calculate graviton interactions (the hypothetical force carriers of gravity) using quantum field theory methods, the probability amplitudes grow without bound as energy increases, violating fundamental principles like unitarity. This behavior starkly contrasts with other force carriers like photons, where such calculations remain well-behaved.
