Key Concepts:   
   
Entropy: The measure of disorder; in closed systems, entropy naturally increases.   
Negentropy: The process by which external energy (or divine grace) restores order.   
Integration:   
   
Sin is modeled as an increase in entropy, while grace acts as a negentropic force.   
Resurrection is viewed as an event where divine intervention retrieves and restores lost information (identity, purpose, spiritual order).
