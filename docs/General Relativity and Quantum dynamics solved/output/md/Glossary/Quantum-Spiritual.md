📌 Quadruple Integral (Spiritual Dimension in the Equation)   
💡 Definition: A quadruple integral expands reality from 3D space into higher dimensions—mirroring the spiritual realm.   
   
1️⃣ Scientific Meaning:   
   
In math & physics, a quadruple integral adds another dimension beyond space & time.   
In relativity, additional dimensions allow time to bend, space to curve, and energy to be exchanged across layers.   
2️⃣ Jesus and This Concept:   
   
Jesus exists beyond time & space: “Before Abraham was, I AM.” — John 8:58   
The Holy Spirit interacts across dimensions: “The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.” — 1 Cor. 2:10   
The Resurrection introduced a higher-dimensional change in reality, making eternal life possible.   
3️⃣ Why It Mirrors Physics & Theology:   
   
Just as time can dilate in physics, prayer transcends time in theology.   
Just as energy can exist in unseen quantum states, faith moves unseen spiritual forces.   
Both science & theology recognize that not all reality is directly observable.
