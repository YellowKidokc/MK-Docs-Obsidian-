ðŸ§  Neuroscience: The Science of the Brain & Mind   
Neuroscience studies how the brain works, how we think, feel, and make decisions.   
   
ðŸ”¹ Important Parts of the Brain:   
âœ… Neurons â€“ Tiny cells that send electrical signals (like a computer).   
âœ… Consciousness â€“ Our awareness and thoughts.   
âœ… Memory â€“ How we remember things.   
âœ… Emotions â€“ Feelings like happiness and fear.   
   
ðŸ‘‰ Example: When you touch something hot, your brain quickly tells your hand to move away! ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥   
   
Neuroscience helps explain why we think, learn, and even make moral choices.
