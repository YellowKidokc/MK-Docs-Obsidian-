📌 Resurrection (As a Mathematical and Spiritual Event)   
💡 Definition: Resurrection is a reversal of entropy—a divine quantum event where death collapses into life.   
   
1️⃣ Scientific Meaning (Quantum Tunneling & Information Conservation):   
   
In quantum mechanics, particles can pass through energy barriers even when it should be impossible—this is called quantum tunneling.   
In physics, information cannot be lost. If Jesus was truly erased from existence, His return would have violated the laws of information conservation. Instead, He returned in a new, glorified state.   
2️⃣ Jesus and Resurrection Power:   
   
The resurrection was not just a miracle—it was a fundamental shift in reality.   
Jesus didn’t just return from the dead—He became something new. “The firstborn from among the dead.” — Colossians 1:18   
3️⃣ Why It Mirrors Physics & Theology:   
   
Entropy states that disorder should always increase. Resurrection reverses entropy, showing a higher law.   
Quantum states collapse when observed. Jesus collapsed the quantum state of death itself, making eternal life the “new default.”   
Black holes absorb information, but resurrection proves no information is truly lost in God’s reality.
