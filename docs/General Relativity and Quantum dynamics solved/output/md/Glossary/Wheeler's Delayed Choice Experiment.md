**Textbook Definition:** Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment is a thought experiment (later realized in actual experiments) that demonstrates the bizarre nature of quantum reality. In this experiment, the decision to measure which path a photon takes through a double-slit apparatus is delayed until after the photon has already passed through the slits. Surprisingly, this delayed choice still determines whether the photon behaved as a particle or a wave earlier in its journey, seemingly affecting the past.   
   
**Simplified for Glossary:** An experiment where a measurement made after a particle has passed through a barrier appears to retroactively determine whether it behaved as a wave or particle, challenging our understanding of cause and effect.
