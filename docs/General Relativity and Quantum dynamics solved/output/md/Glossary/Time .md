ðŸ”¹ Time   
ðŸ‘‰ Time is how we measure change and events from past to present to future.   
âœ… In physics, time flows forward, but it can move differently depending on gravity and speed.   
âœ… In spirituality, time can feel faster or slower based on choices, emotions, or faith.   
Example: Time feels slow when youâ€™re waiting for your birthday but fast when you're having fun.
