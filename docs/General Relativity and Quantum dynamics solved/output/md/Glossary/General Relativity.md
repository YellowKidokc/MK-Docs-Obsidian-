4. General Relativity   
Key Concepts:   
   
Spacetime Curvature: Mass and energy curve spacetime, influencing the motion of objects.   
Event Horizons & Escape Velocity: In a black hole, nothing escapes once past the event horizon.   
Integration:   
   
Death is analogized as an event horizon—an ultimate barrier of entropy.
