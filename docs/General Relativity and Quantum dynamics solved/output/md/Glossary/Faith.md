ðŸ”¹ Faith   
ðŸ‘‰ Faith is believing in something even when you canâ€™t see or prove it.   
âœ… It can be spiritual (believing in God) or practical (trusting your friend).   
âœ… Faith isnâ€™t just wishful thinkingâ€”itâ€™s a deep belief that something is real or will happen.   
Example: If you sit on a chair without checking it, you have faith that it wonâ€™t break.
