title: Evaluation of Uploaded Grant Proposals Against John Templeton Foundation OFI
  Requirements
---
   
I’ve reviewed the uploaded documents against the John Templeton Foundation’s Online Funding Inquiry (OFI) requirements. The key findings and a detailed breakdown of how each proposal aligns (or doesn’t align) with those requirements are available in this report:   
   
# Evaluation of Uploaded Grant Proposals Against John Templeton Foundation OFI Requirements   
   
The John Templeton Foundation’s **Online Funding Inquiry (OFI) Instructions and Notes** specify a set of elements that must be addressed in a funding inquiry. Key requirements include a clear, non‑technical project title, an executive summary that answers specific questions (what, how, why, deliverables, and impact), a detailed project description, a statement of significance, lists of outputs and outcomes, an explanation of the team’s capacity for success, a discussion of alignment with Sir John Templeton’s philanthropic vision, disclosure of any related past Templeton grants, proposed start/end dates within the Foundation’s limits, personnel information, and appropriate budget justification. The following table summarizes whether each uploaded document addresses these elements.

## Findings   
   
1. **Executive Summaries:** The instructions require an executive summary that answers specific questions about the project’s goals, activities, necessity, deliverables, and impact, written in accessible language. Most proposals provide a summary but do not explicitly address all five questions; some are more conceptual than explanatory.   
       
2. **Statement of Significance:** A distinct “Statement of Significance” is required, describing current conditions, problems addressed, and opportunities. None of the proposals include a standalone section with this heading; significance is sometimes embedded in broader narrative sections.   
       
3. **Outputs and Outcomes:** The OFI requires separate lists of outputs (deliverables) and outcomes (changes expected within five years). The proposals generally describe deliverables and impacts but rarely distinguish between outputs and outcomes, and none provide the five‑year perspective.   
       
4. **Alignment with Templeton Vision:** Applicants must explain how their project advances Sir John Templeton’s philanthropic vision and donor intent. Some proposals mention unifying science and spirituality but do not explicitly connect to Templeton’s donor intent.   
       
5. **Previous Templeton Funding:** The OFI form asks whether the work is similar to or expands upon past Templeton grants. None of the documents address this question.   
       
6. **Start and End Dates:** The OFI requires a start date at least six weeks after the funding cycle and an end date within 33–36 months. The proposals specify durations (18–48 months) but do not provide start dates; some propose durations longer than the allowed 36 months.   
       
7. **Budget and Timeline:** Most proposals include budget justification and project timelines. These sections are generally consistent with the level of detail requested.   
       
8. **Team Qualifications:** Each proposal includes biographical sketches of the principal investigator and co‑investigators, addressing the “capacity for success” requirement.   
       
   
### Conclusion   
   
While the uploaded documents provide rich and detailed project concepts, **none of them fully meet all the required elements of the John Templeton Foundation’s Online Funding Inquiry instructions**. The most common omissions are a distinct statement of significance, explicit separation of outputs and outcomes, a clear explanation of alignment with Templeton’s donor intent, disclosure of any related past Templeton grants, and specific start/end dates within the Foundation’s 36‑month limit. To align with the OFI requirements, each proposal should be revised to incorporate these elements explicitly and succinctly.   
   
In summary, while the proposals are rich in ideas and detail, **none of them fully meet all the OFI requirements**. Common omissions include:   
   
   
- A distinct “Statement of Significance” explaining current conditions, problems addressed, and opportunities.   
       
   
- Clear separation of outputs and outcomes and a five‑year outlook for outcomes.   
       
   
- Explicit discussion of alignment with Sir John Templeton’s donor intent.   
       
   
- Disclosure of previous Templeton funding or related projects.   
       
   
- Specific start and end dates within the Foundation’s 33‑36‑month limit.   
       
   
Each proposal does include a project title, a summary, team qualifications, and budget information, but the elements above need to be addressed before submission.

Below is a detailed analysis of each uploaded document, outlining which Online Funding Inquiry (OFI) requirements are missing and where those missing elements should be incorporated. The relevant OFI requirements come from the instructions that specify the need for a clear project title, an executive summary answering five questions, a detailed project description, a **statement of significance**, lists of **outputs** and **outcomes**, a **capacity for success** section, an explanation of how the project aligns with Sir John Templeton’s donor intent, a disclosure of any prior Templeton grants, a proposed start and end date within the allowed duration, and appropriate budget justification.   
   
### 1. _Bridging the Paradox.md_   
   
   
- **Missing Statement of Significance**: The OFI instructions call for a section describing current conditions, the problem addressed, and the opportunity. This document includes a “Significance and Innovation” section, but it mainly explains the central paradox and proposed integration. It does not explicitly set out the current state of research, why this project is needed, or the opportunity it presents. **Where to add**: Insert a distinct “Statement of Significance” section immediately after the executive summary that reviews the current landscape in quantum gravity and consciousness, the gaps, and why this project is timely.   
       
   
- **Outputs vs. Outcomes**: The proposal describes deliverables and broader impacts, but it does not provide a clear list of outputs (events or work products) and outcomes (changes expected within five years). **Where to add**: After the project description and before the team qualifications, include two separate lists—one titled “Outputs” detailing deliverables such as unified field equations, published papers, workshops, etc., and another titled “Outcomes” describing anticipated impacts or changes within five years of project completion.   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**: The proposal notes “Unifying Knowledge” and “Responsible AI Development,” but does not explicitly connect the work to Sir John Templeton’s philanthropic vision. **Where to add**: After the capacity for success or near the conclusion, include a section called “Alignment with Templeton Vision” explaining how integrating science and spirituality advances the Foundation’s aims (such as inspiring humility, wonder, and new spiritual insights).   
       
   
- **Previous Templeton Grants**: The OFI form asks whether this project builds on or expands previous Templeton-funded work. This document does not address that question. **Where to add**: Insert a brief section near the end (before or after the budget) titled “Relationship to Previous Templeton Grants,” stating whether this is a new idea or extends earlier work, and providing details if relevant.   
       
   
- **Start and End Dates**: The proposal offers a 48‑month timeline, exceeding the Foundation’s 36‑month limit for most organizations. It also omits specific start and end dates. **Where to add**: In the timeline or budget section, specify a proposed start date (at least six weeks after the relevant funding cycle) and adjust the end date to fall within 36 months. Include both dates explicitly.   
       
   
### 2. _David Claude 2.md_   
   
   
- **Executive Summary Gaps**: The summary addresses intellectual merit and broader impacts but does not explicitly answer all five questions (what questions the project will answer, what activities will be done, why the project is needed, what deliverables will be produced, and what impact it will have). **Where to add**: Rework the summary or add sentences to answer each of those questions succinctly.   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance**: The document discusses the “Fundamental Question” and the “False Dichotomy,” but lacks a standalone statement describing current conditions, the problem, and the opportunity. **Where to add**: Create a “Statement of Significance” section after the project summary, explaining why bridging mathematics and theology is pressing and what opportunity this project seizes.   
       
   
- **Outputs vs. Outcomes**: Although it lists year‑1 and year‑2 deliverables and some broader impacts, it does not explicitly label them as outputs and outcomes. **Where to add**: Separate the deliverables (e.g., pattern database, translation system, publications) under “Outputs” and the anticipated changes within five years (e.g., integrated curricula, transformed public discourse) under “Outcomes.”   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**: The conclusion mentions Templeton’s interest in “Big Questions,” but it does not explicitly tie the work to donor intent. **Where to add**: Add a brief section after team qualifications titled “Alignment with Templeton Vision,” explaining how integrating mathematical precision and spiritual insight aligns with the Foundation’s aim of exploring ultimate reality and human flourishing.   
       
   
- **Previous Templeton Grants** & **Start/End Dates**: As with the previous document, these sections are absent. Include a “Previous Templeton Funding” section and specify start and end dates within the 36‑month limit in the timeline or budget section.   
       
   
### 3. _David Claude 3.md_   
   
   
- **Executive Summary Incomplete**: It mentions intellectual merit and broader impacts, but it does not answer all five required questions. Expand the summary to state which research questions are addressed, what activities will occur in each phase, why the work is needed, the key deliverables, and the expected impact.   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance**: There is no separate section summarizing current conditions and the need/opportunity. Add a “Statement of Significance” after the summary.   
       
   
- **Outputs vs. Outcomes**: The proposal lists year‑1 deliverables and long‑term impacts but does not separate outputs from outcomes. Create dedicated “Outputs” and “Outcomes” lists after the methodology.   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**, **Previous Templeton Grants**, **Start/End Dates**: These sections are missing. Add them as described above and ensure the duration (18 months) includes specific start and end dates.   
       
   
### 4. _David Gemini 3.md_   
   
   
- **Missing Executive Summary**: There is no formal executive summary answering the required questions. The document begins with a project description. **Where to add**: Insert a “Project Summary” section at the beginning that briefly covers the questions (what, how, why, deliverables, impact).   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance** and **Outputs/Outcomes**: These sections are absent. **Where to add**: After the project description, create a “Statement of Significance” and separate “Outputs” and “Outcomes” sections.   
       
   
- **Capacity for Success**: The document lacks details on team qualifications. **Where to add**: Include a “Team Qualifications” section describing the PI and co‑investigator(s).   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**, **Previous Grants**, **Start/End Dates**, **Budget and Timeline**: None of these appear. Add them in appropriate places: near the end for alignment and previous grants, and include start/end dates and a detailed budget.   
       
   
### 5. _David Gemini 4.md_   
   
   
- **Executive Summary**: It covers an overview, intellectual merit and broader impacts, but does not explicitly address all required questions. Add explicit sentences in the summary answering what the project will address, what activities are planned, why they are needed, what the deliverables will be, and what impact is expected.   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance**: The proposal discusses “The Collaborative Intelligence Imperative” but lacks a separate significance section. Insert this after the summary.   
       
   
- **Outputs vs. Outcomes**: The expected outcomes and deliverables are described together; they should be separated and categorized. Add distinct “Outputs” and “Outcomes” lists.   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**: The proposal targets the NSF program and does not address Templeton donor intent. If it is intended for Templeton, include a section on alignment with their vision.   
       
   
- **Previous Grants**, **Start/End Dates**: These are missing; add them as described previously.   
       
   
### 6. _The David Effect.md_   
   
   
- **Executive Summary**: While it discusses overview, intellectual merit and broader impacts, it does not explicitly answer all five required questions. Expand the summary to cover those points.   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance**, **Outputs/Outcomes**, **Alignment with Templeton Vision**, **Previous Grants**, **Start/End Dates**: All are missing. Add these sections in the same positions as recommended for earlier proposals.   
       
   
### 7. _The Fourth Dimension.md_   
   
   
- **Executive Summary**: Similar to other proposals, it covers overview and merit but not all five questions. Revise or expand the summary accordingly.   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance**: Absent; add a section summarizing current knowledge gaps on higher dimensions and spiritual phenomena and the opportunity this project addresses.   
       
   
- **Outputs/Outcomes**: The document discusses practical applications but does not provide separate lists. Add dedicated “Outputs” and “Outcomes” sections after the technical approach.   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**, **Previous Grants**, **Start/End Dates**: These sections need to be added. Make sure the 36‑month duration includes explicit start and end dates within Templeton’s limits.   
       
   
### 8. _The Logical Entropy…_ (outline)   
   
   
- This document is an outline for a paper rather than a grant proposal. It lacks all the required OFI components: executive summary, project description, statement of significance, outputs/outcomes, team qualifications, alignment with Templeton’s vision, previous grants, start/end dates, and budget. To convert it into a compliant proposal, each of these sections would need to be developed and placed in the same positions as for the other proposals (summary at the top, followed by significance, description, outputs/outcomes, team, alignment, funding history, timeline, and budget).   
       
   
### 9. _The Master Equation.md_   
   
   
- **Executive Summary**: It provides an overview and broader impacts but does not explicitly answer all five questions. Clarify the specific questions addressed, activities planned, reasons for the project, deliverables, and impact in the summary.   
       
   
- **Statement of Significance**: There is no separate statement that surveys current conditions and articulates the opportunity. Insert this section after the summary.   
       
   
- **Outputs vs. Outcomes**: The document lists technical deliverables and broader impacts together. Distinguish between outputs and outcomes in separate lists.   
       
   
- **Alignment with Templeton Vision**: The proposal discusses reconciling science and spirituality but does not explicitly connect to Templeton donor intent. Add a section on alignment with the Foundation’s philanthropic vision.   
       
   
- **Previous Grants** & **Start/End Dates**: These are missing. Specify whether the work builds on prior Templeton funding and provide a start date and end date within 36 months.   
       
   
- **Duration Issue**: The proposed 48‑month duration exceeds the Templeton limit. Adjust the project duration and include specific dates.   
       
   
   
---   
   
By inserting the missing sections in the suggested locations—immediately after the summary for significance, after the description for outputs/outcomes, and near the end for alignment with Templeton’s vision and funding history—you can bring each document into conformity with the OFI requirements.
