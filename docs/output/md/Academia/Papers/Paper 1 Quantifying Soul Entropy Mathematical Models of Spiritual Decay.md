This technical paper would develop a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding spiritual entropy, including:   
   
   
- Derivation of the spiritual entropy equation with detailed explanation of variables   
- Modeling of decay rates in various spiritual systems (individuals, communities, civilizations)   
- Introduction of a "grace coefficient" that measures resistance to entropic forces   
- Statistical analysis of spiritual decay patterns across historical religious movements   
- Differential equations showing the relationship between input frequency (prayer, worship) and entropy reduction
