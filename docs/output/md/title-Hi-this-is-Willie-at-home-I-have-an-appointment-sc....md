Hi this is Willie at home I have an appointment scheduled for Thursday at 2:00 and I ended up having to go into work at Ford and I think it's gonna be too close can I come in earlier in the day or maybe on Friday Yeah Do you have anything else at all or anything Friday how about on Friday OK I will go back on time All right thank you very much Alright bye bye I do not hope you know so I said that whole thing I said although if you're it would be easy to do what if you do I do know You probably don't ever ask because yeah you get a you get to go home so you're always excited What's your mindset of like it changes I want to I want to go to heaven right now your sowing spirit Is that I'm i'm not sure if that's even how many people really ever attain that whether that close to God that they don't want this world anymore I assume that 0 Christy bar there's like two people I asked like I'm ready to go right I didn't have that many attachments to people but I have enough that I don't want to yeah do you think I should put that you know because I can get that whole thing about like I don't consider losing healings and it's all kind of negative but I kind of want to get more of a book Yeah but maybe just tell him that you have seen documented instances where does work in groups I mean I don't know if I would tell him that because he's gonna be like Oh yeah we can I tell you one way my prayer gets answered you know that's like a long shot   
   
Do you want me to make this sound more like a personal testimony/story (raw and conversational) or more like a reflection/teaching piece (structured for others to read and take a lesson from)?   
Julie should be having your about now
