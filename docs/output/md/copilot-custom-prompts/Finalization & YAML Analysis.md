I need you to analyze {{activeNote}} and generate complete, comprehensive YAML frontmatter based on David Lowe's research template system.   
   
ANALYSIS TASK:   
   
- Read the entire active note content (YAML + body text)   
- Replace all "AI-will-tag", "AI-will-categorize", "AI-will-determine", "AI-will-assess" placeholders   
- Generate COMPREHENSIVE tags from: theophysics, quantum-consciousness, bible-prophecy, foundation-crisis, entangled-soul, universal-laws, decoherence, consciousness-interface, end-times, pear-data, master-equation, spiritual-physics, divine-revelation, information-theory, scriptural-analysis, prophecy-correlation, consciousness-studies, quantum-mechanics, biblical-theology, research-breakthrough   
- Add content-specific tags based on what you find   
- Determine research framework: Quantum-Consciousness-Prophecy, 10 Universal Laws, THEOPHYSICS, or Entangled Soul Theory   
- Assess significance: paradigm-shifting, breakthrough, important, supporting, preliminary   
- Extract ALL Bible references   
- Generate extensive SEO keywords   
- Write compelling description   
- Set ai_processed: true   
   
PUBLISHING QUESTIONS:   
Ask me these three questions:   
1. "Publish to PRODUCTION site (curated research)? (Y/N)"   
2. "Publish to RESEARCH site (full vault)? (Y/N)"    
3. "Publish to TEMPLATE site (framework examples)? (Y/N)"   
   
OUTPUT: Complete YAML frontmatter block with publish_to settings based on my answers, ready to replace existing frontmatter.
