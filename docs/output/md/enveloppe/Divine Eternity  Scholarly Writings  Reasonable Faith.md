## No Trouble   
   
Eric Wielenberg’s two alleged contradictions in my view of God, time, and creation are easily resolved. The first is dissolved by appreciating that God’s power to create the universe is a&...

## Omniscience, Tensed Facts, and Divine Eternity   
   
A difficulty for a view of divine eternity as timelessness is that if time is tensed, then God, in virtue of His omniscience, must know tensed facts. But tensed facts, such as It is now t, can only be...

## God and the Beginning of Time   
   
Leibniz's question to Clarke, "Why Did God Not Create the Word Sooner?" poses a difficult problem for theists holding to a neo-Newtonian view that God is omnitemporal and that time is beginningles...

## The Eternal Present and Stump-Kretzmann Eternity   
   
A classic difficulty of the conception of divine eternity as timelessness is that it seems impossible for an atemporal deity to be causally active in the world. Stump and Kretzmann, in their seminal a...

## Timelessness and Omnitemporality   
   
How shall we construe divine eternity and God's relationship to time? The view that God is simply timeless faces two insuperable difficulties: (1) an atemporal deity cannot be causally related to ...

## On the Alleged Metaphysical Superiority of Timelessness   
   
Brian Leftow argues that timeless beings are metaphysically superior to temporal beings in view of their truer presence and unity. Leftow's argument that a timeless being has truer presence is bas...

## Divine Timelessness and Personhood

     1. God is timeless     
and     
     2. God is personal     
are broadly l...

## The Special Theory of Relativity and Theories of Divine Eternity   
   
Contemporary analyses of divine eternity often make explicit appeal to to the Special Theory of Relativity in support of the doctrine of divine timelessness. For example, two fundamental tenets of Lef...

## God, Time and Eternity   
   
Is God's eternity to be construed as timeless or temporal? Given that the universe began to exist, a relational view of time suggests that time also began to exist. God's existence "prior to" ...

## Divine Timelessness and Necessary Existence   
   
Brian Leftow argues that if God is temporal, He is essentially temporal; and that since He is a necessary being, time therefore exists necessarily, but that since time is in fact contingent, God is th...

## Timelessness and Creation   
   
Brian Leftow argues that a temporal God could not be the creator of time and that therefore God should be conceived as timeless. Leftow's first argument, that there is no time at which a temporal ...

## On the Argument for Divine Timelessness from the Incompleteness of Temporal Life   
   
A promising argument for divine timelessness is that temporal life is possessed only moment by moment, which is incompatible with the existence of a perfect being. Since the argument is based on the e...

## A Critique of Grudem's Formulation and Defense of the Doctrine of Divine Eternity

## A Review of Paul Helm's _Eternal God_   
   
Paul Helm's Eternal God is an important defense of the construal of divine eternity as timeless. I show that Helm's construal presupposes a tenseless (or B-Theory) of time without sufficient j...

## God and Real Time   
   
Whether God is timeless or temporal depends on whether an A-Theory or B-Theory of time is correct, where the former posits tensed facts and the latter only tenseless facts. Given the superiority of th...
