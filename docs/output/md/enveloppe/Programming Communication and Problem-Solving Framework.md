---
   
# Programming Communication and Problem-Solving Framework   
   
## Intent Communication Commands   
   
### /GOAL   
   
_Communication Prompt:_ "What are we trying to achieve at the highest level?"   
   
Copy   
   
`/GOAL - Primary objective: Build inventory management system - End users: Warehouse staff - Key requirements: Real-time updates, barcode scanning - Success metrics: 99.9% accuracy, <500ms response time`   
   
### /CONTEXT   
   
_Communication Prompt:_ "What's the existing environment and constraints?"   
   
Copy   
   
`/CONTEXT - Current stack: Python/Django backend - Database: PostgreSQL - Infrastructure: AWS - Performance requirements: 1000 concurrent users - Security requirements: SOC2 compliance`   
   
### /CLARIFY   
   
_Communication Prompt:_ "Let's confirm understanding before coding."   
   
Copy   
   
`/CLARIFY inventory_system - Is this correct? System will:   1. Track real-time inventory levels  2. Support barcode scanning via mobile app  3. Generate alerts at low stock levels  4. Maintain audit trail - Questions:   1. Should prices be included?  2. What's the expected item count?`   
   
## Problem-Solving Commands   
   
### /APPROACH   
   
_Solution Prompt:_ "Let's design the solution architecture."   
   
Copy   
   
`/APPROACH inventory_tracking 1. Data Model:    - Items (id, name, sku, quantity)   - Movements (item_id, quantity_delta, timestamp) 2. API Design:    - REST endpoints for CRUD   - WebSocket for real-time updates 3. Technology Choices:    - Django REST framework   - Redis for caching   - Celery for async tasks`   
   
### /PATTERN   
   
_Solution Prompt:_ "What design patterns fit this problem?"   
   
Copy   
   
`/PATTERN - Observer: For inventory level notifications - Command: For tracking all modifications - Repository: For data access abstraction - Strategy: For different pricing models`   
   
### /RISKS   
   
_Solution Prompt:_ "What could go wrong? Let's address it upfront."   
   
Copy   
   
`/RISKS 1. Race Conditions:    - Solution: Optimistic locking 2. Data Consistency:    - Solution: Transaction boundaries 3. Performance:    - Solution: Caching strategy 4. Security:    - Solution: Input validation, rate limiting`   
   
## Implementation Commands   
   
### /SCAFFOLD   
   
_Code Prompt:_ "Generate initial project structure."   
   
Copy   
   
`/SCAFFOLD django_inventory - Create project skeleton - Set up basic models - Configure authentication - Add testing framework - Initialize documentation`   
   
### /MODULE   
   
_Code Prompt:_ "Generate specific module with tests."   
   
Copy   
   
`/MODULE inventory_tracker - Core functionality - Unit tests - Integration tests - Documentation - Usage examples`   
   
### /OPTIMIZE   
   
_Code Prompt:_ "Enhance performance and reliability."   
   
Copy   
   
`/OPTIMIZE 1. Database:    - Add indexes   - Optimize queries 2. Caching:    - Add Redis caching   - Configure cache invalidation 3. Async:    - Move heavy tasks to background`   
   
## Testing Commands   
   
### /TEST   
   
_Testing Prompt:_ "Comprehensive test coverage."   
   
Copy   
   
`/TEST inventory_module 1. Unit Tests:    - CRUD operations   - Business logic 2. Integration Tests:    - API endpoints   - Database transactions 3. Load Tests:    - Concurrent users   - Data volume`   
   
### /EDGE   
   
_Testing Prompt:_ "Identify and test edge cases."   
   
Copy   
   
`/EDGE 1. Data Boundaries:    - Maximum quantities   - Unicode product names 2. Timing Issues:    - Concurrent updates   - System downtime 3. Error Conditions:    - Network failures   - Database deadlocks`   
   
## Documentation Commands   
   
### /DOC   
   
_Documentation Prompt:_ "Generate comprehensive documentation."   
   
Copy   
   
`/DOC inventory_api 1. API Reference:    - Endpoints   - Parameters   - Response formats 2. Integration Guide:    - Authentication   - Rate limits   - Best practices 3. Examples:    - Common use cases   - Code samples`   
   
## Knowledge Management Commands   
   
### /LOG   
   
_Learning Prompt:_ "Record what we learned."   
   
Copy   
   
`/LOG transaction_issue Problem: - Deadlock during high-volume updates Solution: - Implemented optimistic locking - Added retry mechanism Lessons: - Always consider concurrent access - Test with realistic data volumes`   
   
### /REVIEW   
   
_Learning Prompt:_ "Analyze what worked and what didn't."   
   
Copy   
   
`/REVIEW sprint_7 Successes: - Caching reduced load by 70% - New API design simplified integration Challenges: - Race conditions in batch updates - Performance with large datasets Solutions: - Implemented queue system - Added database partitioning`   
   
## Integration Patterns   
   
### Common Problem-Solving Pipeline:   
   
Copy   
   
`/GOAL + /CONTEXT + /CLARIFY + /APPROACH + /RISKS "Define problem completely before starting implementation."`   
   
### Implementation Pipeline:   
   
Copy   
   
`/SCAFFOLD + /MODULE + /TEST + /OPTIMIZE "Build, test, and optimize in structured sequence."`   
   
### Learning Pipeline:   
   
Copy   
   
`/LOG + /REVIEW + /DOC "Capture knowledge and improve future iterations."`   
   
## Usage Best Practices   
   
1. Always start with /GOAL and /CONTEXT   
2. Use /CLARIFY before any major implementation   
3. Maintain /LOG entries for significant problems/solutions   
4. Run complete /TEST suite before optimization   
5. Update /DOC with each significant change   
   
## Feedback Loop   
   
6. Record challenges and solutions   
7. Review patterns in issues   
8. Update approach based on lessons learned   
9. Maintain knowledge base for future reference   
   
This framework promotes:   
   
   
- Clear communication   
- Structured problem-solving   
- Knowledge retention   
- Continuous improvement   
- Reusable patterns
