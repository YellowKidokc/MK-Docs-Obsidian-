destroyer off the coast doing anti piracy operations The boat was ready and aware and they were jacked up like they didn't even know we were there thought they were well I think Brady had him shoot like 24 rounds or something off the deck guns in the valley and walked him so we get back down to our patrol base five minutes after we're there a little Navy dude comes knocking on the door opens the door comes in he says hey the admiral in charge of the base needs whoever was just involved in whatever went down to come brief him the whole way over there were like we're screwed like this dude is going to flip a gasket like who are you how was I not aware of this How did you involve my warship that I'm responsible for who cleared this and he's like so you guys the three of you just decided you

them carried over And and listen good work they're a great start we're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research Excuse me teresa is it there are no holes in my research no offense they're just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask don't talk to me like I'm an idiot OK I may not have a law degree but I've spent 18 months on this case and I know more about these plaintiffs than you ever will Aaron you don't even have phone numbers for some of them whose number do you need everyone's this is a lawsuit we need to be able to contact the plaintiffs I said whose number do you need You don't know 600 plaintiffs numbers by heart Annabelle Daniels Annabelle Daniels 714-454-9346 ten years old 11 in May lived on the plume since birth wanted to be a synchronized swimmer so she spent every minute she could in the PG and E pool she had a tumor in her brainstem detected last November and operation on Thanksgiving shrunk it with radiation after that her parents are Ted and Rita ted's got Crohn's disease rita has chronic headaches and nausea and underwent a hysterectomy last fall ted grew up in Hinckley his brother Robbie and his wife May and their five children Robbie Junior Martha Ed Rose and Peter also lived on the plume their number is 454-9554 you want their diseases OK look I think we got off on the wrong foot here that's all you got lady Two wrong feet in ugly shoes The United States government is offering you a piece of land of your own We have our own land no it's it's not yours it's the US governments Anybody know who they trade for it's not like that we then how can they own it He has a point If you accept our offer you won't have to hunt Buffalo anymore or roll the Prairie you can depend on your country to take care of you You are not my country senator Crane has come here to offer your people a better way of life better than what better than what you have I like what I have I understand that But your people Adidas just made me an offer for 100 million that's a third of what your company's worth I really want to take it not letting you sell your company for pennies on the dollar life is short of burnt out you want to sell sell but we built this company from the ground up give me a week to get you a better offer I'll give you the same thing they're giving me 48 hours then I'll take it I'll give you the same thing they're giving me 48 hours then I'll take it Here's one more thing what difference does it make I can't delay the sale if I don't know why my client is dumping his company on a whim that's the one more thing mr Doyle's best friend died a month ago you gave my client 48 hours to take your offer i'm going to give you 5 minutes to take my double your money or I walk out the door that's ridiculous what's ridiculous is you praying on a man who just lost his leg long friend because he's grieving I have the ability to go to the board and delay this sale but you're not going to because you know it'll drive down the price even more when he eventually wants to sell anyway You're right it'll still be worth more than your offer after my client's grief passes he may steal himself but it shows how it won't be to you The man noticed something strange The buyer loaded the gun three seconds faster than he did even when he intentionally misaligned the scope she spotted the issue right away she adjusted it just once and the sniper rifle hit a target a full kilometer away The man started thinking not long ago he had told the organization he wanted to retire and right after that they arranged this deal there had to be a connection but what surprised him was the buyer handed the weapon to him and asked him to fire beside her to test the silencer he could have easily killed her right then but he didn't Instead he thought of a better plan the buyer was very satisfied with the weapon and was ready to close the deal but the man claims some parts still needed adjustments luckily the buyer didn't suspect anything and agreed to wait so Jack on his way back kicked and damaged his car bumper and went to a repair shop while the owner was fixing the car he tried to quietly steal a few useful parts to modify the weapon but the owner caught him in the act After getting home he immediately took apart the purchase parts he placed spacers hammered them into place cut the steel pipe into 12 segments stacked them with spacers then slid on the prepared outer shell it fit perfectly a silencer cleanly assembled with no visible signs of tampering to make sure it matched the gun he bought a second hand one from the black market took it apart completely then reassembled it it looked exactly like the original even adjusted the precision of the parts on purpose next came the most important step he used a file to flatten the bullet tip then drilled a small hole into it he filled the hole with a drop of mercury even if the bullet didn't hit a vital organ the mercury was deadly enough the next day the deal went on as planned but right after Jack handed the special bullets to the buyer she suddenly said she needed to use the bathroom and wanted to test the gun again even the waiter rushed into the kitchen jack was left alone in the restaurant something felt off when he saw the buyer return he quickly slipped the hidden gun into his pocket OK I'm fine you just fine You never know luckily she didn't notice anything unusual jack looked at the money in his hand and decided to leave this dangerous place the next day jack planned to tell his wife they should leave together but he didn't know he was already being targeted he was about to be shot in the head He rushed to check the killer was the same buyer from yesterday and notice something strange The fire loaded the gun three seconds faster than he did even when he intentionally misaligned the scope she spotted the issue right away she adjusted it just once and the sniper rifle hit a target a full kilometer away The man started thinking not long ago he had told the organization he wanted to retire good job getting me in here while it's still virgin snow let's grab these up before the show starts What the **** red dots that means sold that means it was a pre preview we got stacked Oh yes you're right so where'd you go from here Oh my God so you're done with the closure 'cause I'd love to buy if you had more yeah I don't pay for money never have more demands well when you do think of it OK do the next thing I don't pay for money means nobody's paying me enough yet so if you can't buy the art buy the artist go go for it I don't see the world the way he does this guy could like that I didn't paint it on Commission before I don't plan on stuff now yeah that works with you stock boys but I'm a painter They have stopped guys I want Michelangelo painted on Commission by the way do we like the Sistine Chapel any less because they paid him to paint it no and Mozart did his best work for bags of gold and we're still talking about him 250 years later i'm not asking for your soul just your next eight paintings no place does get good life during the day sure does would you all get me in here while it's still virgins Because the thing that the reason why I like my life works in golf and off the golf course is because I follow instruction right so if I see somebody doing a

--- Preparing for 'Condensing Window' Analysis ---   
To quantify a 'condensing window' or 'X-factor', we need to precisely define what 'condensing' means.   
This could involve:   
1. Rate of fulfillment: Number of prophecies fulfilled per unit of historical time (e.g., per century).   
2. Decreasing gap: Time difference between revelation and fulfillment for prophecies.   
3. Increasing intensity/frequency of future events as prophetic timeline progresses.   
   
Regarding the '78.7 or 7.6' factor for '1BIBLE prophecy right' you mentioned:   
Could you please provide a more detailed definition or the formula for how this factor is calculated?   
Knowing this precise metric will allow me to incorporate its calculation directly into the analysis.   
For instance, is it related to the statistical improbability of a particular set of prophecies being fulfilled by chance?

--- Preparing for 'Condensing Window' Analysis ---   
To quantify a 'condensing window' or 'X-factor', we need to precisely define what 'condensing' means.   
This could involve:   
1. Rate of fulfillment: Number of prophecies fulfilled per unit of historical time (e.g., per century).   
2. Decreasing gap: Time difference between revelation and fulfillment for prophecies.   
3. Increasing intensity/frequency of future events as prophetic timeline progresses.   
   
Regarding the '78.7 or 7.6' factor for '1BIBLE prophecy right' you mentioned:   
Could you please provide a more detailed definition or the formula for how this factor is calculated?   
Knowing this precise metric will allow me to incorporate its calculation directly into the analysis.   
For instance, is it related to the statistical improbability of a particular set of prophecies being fulfilled by chance?
