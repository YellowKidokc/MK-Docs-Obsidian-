### Jesus, Everlasting Father   
   
The parable opens with an old man scanning the horizon.     
Every dawn he kneads hope like breadâ€”eyes straining for a silhouette that never comes.     
Until one afternoon it does: a rag-clad son, spine bent by shame, trudging home on blistered feet.     
The father runs.     
Robes flap, dust swirls, decorum collapses.     
No lecture, just an embrace capacious enough to smuggle the whole cosmos inside.   
   
Physicists nickname that kind of embrace **Strong Nuclear Force**â€”a binding energy so potent it holds protons together despite their mutual repulsion.     
You and I are the repulsive particles; Jesus, the Everlasting Father, is the binding energy that refuses to let the family atom split.

#### How Creation Echoes His Fatherhood   
   
   
- **Conservation of Energy** â€“ Nothing true is ever lost, only transfigured. The prodigalâ€™s wasted years re-enter the system as music at a feast.   
       
   
- **Quantum Entanglement** â€“ The Fatherâ€™s heart and the childâ€™s soul remain correlated no matter how many pigpens lie between them.   
       
   
- **Second-Law Reversal** â€“ Entropy dictates that ordered things unravel, yet forgiveness re-threads the fibers of a ruined life.   
       
   
- **Speed-of-Light Constant** â€“ Love travels the only velocity that never changes with perspective: c for compassion.

#### Tuesday-Morning Theology   
   
Pour coffee; steam rises. That vapor is waterâ€™s escape velocityâ€”molecules breaking orbit because they received just enough heat. Grace is similar: the exact energy required for guilt to evaporate without destroying the cup that holds it.   
   
Check your phone; a text from an old friend blinks.     
Answer it. Wordsâ€”massless packetsâ€”bridge years in milliseconds.     
Prayer works the same data channel, but the Everlasting Father replies before the packet is sent.

#### Why This Matters Before the Traffic Light Turns Green   
   
1. **Security, not Surveillance** â€“ His omnipresence is a porch-light left on, not a security camera.   
       
2. **Discipline without Distance** â€“ Correction is inside the hug, not across the room.   
       
3. **Inheritance in Real Time** â€“ You donâ€™t wait for heaven; sonship accrues compound interest now.

A blessing for the road:     
_May the Strong Force of the Father knit your loose ends,     
may the unspent energy of grace recycle every failure into feast,     
and may you feel His sprint toward youâ€”sandals slapping dustâ€”long before you crest the hill._ ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
