## Executive Summary   
   
This project seeks to reconcile one of the deepest paradoxes in modern science: the incompatibility between quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the subjective experience of consciousness. By reframing these domains in terms of information dynamics, we propose a unifying framework that treats physical reality and conscious observation as interdependent aspects of a single underlying process.     
     
The research will develop a mathematical formalism that links spacetime curvature, quantum state evolution, and informational entropy in a testable model. Predictions will be evaluated against phenomena in quantum information experiments, gravitational lensing, and cognitive neuroscience.     
     
The goal is a rigorously defined bridge between physics and mind sciences, producing both peer-reviewed publications and public-facing resources to make the findings accessible beyond academia.   
   
## Project Description   
   
Phase 1 — Theoretical Synthesis     
   
- Review and integrate existing mathematical tools from quantum information theory, general relativity, and thermodynamics.     
- Identify parameters linking physical observables to cognitive/informational variables.     
     
Phase 2 — Framework Development     
   
- Derive equations expressing the interplay between spacetime geometry, quantum states, and observer information states.     
- Run computational simulations to explore stability and edge cases.     
     
Phase 3 — Empirical Validation     
   
- Collaborate with experimental groups in quantum optics and neuroimaging to test key predictions.     
- Compare results with known anomalies in each domain.   
   
## Statement of Significance   
   
Unifying these three domains would not only advance theoretical physics but also open measurable pathways for studying consciousness within a physical framework. This project could reshape how we understand causality, free will, and the emergence of complexity in the universe.   
   
## Outputs   
   
   
- Peer-reviewed articles in physics and neuroscience journals.     
- Computational model code and open dataset.     
- Conference presentations at interdisciplinary symposia.     
- Public explainer series on “Physics and the Mind.”   
   
## Outcomes   
   
   
- New testable models linking physics and consciousness.     
- Expanded interdisciplinary research collaborations.     
- Enhanced public literacy in science–mind integration.   
   
## Capacity for Success   
   
The PI brings expertise in theoretical physics and philosophy of mind, with prior publications in interdisciplinary science. Collaborators include physicists, neuroscientists, and computational modelers.   
   
## Alignment with Templeton Vision   
   
Addresses “Big Questions” about the ultimate nature of reality and the place of mind within it. Expands human understanding of the deep structure of the universe.
