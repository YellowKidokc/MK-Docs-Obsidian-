title: Law Files Organization Analysis & Python Script Plan
---
   
# Law Files Organization Analysis & Python Script Plan   
   
## Pattern Analysis from Current Files:   
   
### Naming Patterns Detected:   
1. **Law Number Patterns:**   
   
   - "Law 1", "Law 2", "LAW 3", "Law 4", etc.   
   - "Law_01", "Law_02", etc.   
   - Mixed case inconsistencies   
   
2. **Content Type Patterns:**   
   
   - "Main Document" = MD (Main Document)   
   - "Introduction" = IN   
   - "Comprehensive Concept Map" = CM   
   - "Story" = ST   
   - "Meta" = MT   
   - "Final for Substack" = Publication ready   
   - "Executive Summary" = ES   
   - Numbered duplicates (1), (2), (3), etc.   
   
3. **Topic Patterns:**   
   
   - Law 1: Gravity, Sin   
   - Law 2: Nuclear, Unity, Entanglement   
   - Law 3: Electromagnetism, Light, Truth   
   - Law 4: Weak Force   
   - Law 5: Thermodynamics, Energy   
   - Law 6: Cause & Effect, Sowing & Reaping   
   - Law 7: Quantum, Uncertainty, Relativity   
   - Law 8: Phase Transitions   
   - Law 9: Forces, Authority   
   - Law 10: Unified, Consciousness   
   
## Python Script Strategy:   
   
### Phase 1: Analysis & Cataloging   
   
- Scan all files and extract law numbers, content types   
- Identify duplicates and versions   
- Create mapping of files to categories   
   
### Phase 2: Smart Renaming   
   
- Apply LW-##-TYPE-DESCRIPTOR naming convention   
- Handle duplicates by moving to review folder   
- Preserve best versions in main categories   
   
### Phase 3: Organization   
   
- Move files to appropriate target folders   
- Generate gap analysis report   
- Create publication readiness assessment   
   
## Script Features Needed:   
1. **File Scanner** - Regex patterns to identify law numbers and types   
2. **Duplicate Detector** - Find numbered versions and similar content   
3. **Smart Categorizer** - Map content to target structure   
4. **Batch Renamer** - Apply LW naming convention   
5. **Gap Analyzer** - Identify missing content types per law   
6. **Quality Assessor** - Identify publication-ready vs draft versions   
   
Would you like me to write this Python script? It could process all 400+ files in seconds rather than hours of manual work.
