###  **![](https://www.jneurophilosophy.com/public/site/images/anka/mceclip0-fe6a8714266b5eb919270905d1727ca7.png) PREPARATION OF ARTICLES**   
   
### **[Please use the article template here when preparing your article (DOWNLOAD JNphi article template), also use it during online submission](https://jneurophilosophy.com/Download/JNphiTemplate.docx)**   
   
Articles should be comprehensive, fully documented reports of original research. They should be concise but with complete results and conclusions. Authors are encouraged to take advantage of the Web features available (including 3D animations, video and sound). Manuscripts should be divided into the following sections: Title page, Abstract, Introduction, Materials and methods, Results and discussion, Conclusion and outlook, Acknowledgments, Abbreviations list, References.   
   
Article title     
The title should clearly and concisely reflect the content of the article. Titles are very important for current awareness and information retrieval and therefore should be carefully constructed for these purposes.   
   
Names and addresses     
For multiple-authored articles list the names and affiliations of all the authors, the email address(es), the full postal addresses, using identifiers to link an author with an address where necessary.   
   
Abstract     
Articles have an abstract, separate from the text, of up to 500 words and that should not contain any references, numbers, abbreviations, or acronyms unless absolutely necessary. The abstract should give readers concise information about the content of the article. It should not only indicate the general scope of the article but also state the main results obtained and conclusions drawn. When preparing their abstracts, authors should keep in mind that this summary is aimed at an interdisciplinary audience which includes readers outside of their field. The abstract is the most important section of the paper since it will be widely and freely disseminated by scientific indexing systems, and will be read far more often than the whole paper. Great care should therefore be taken to provide an informative abstract which summarizes the main argument of the paper.    
   
Keywords     
All authors are required to provide up to five keywords characterizing the topic of their article. Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 5 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.   
   
Introduction     
An introduction of up to 800 words should include a statement explaining the motivation for the research and should accurately place the investigations in context with previous or current work in the field.   
   
Experimental section     
This section provides a clear, unambiguous description of methods, materials and equipment in sufficient detail to permit reproduction of the work. Please note that communications, which are preliminary reports of original significant research results, should keep experimental details to a minimum.   
   
Results and discussion     
These sections should present the results and interpret them in a clear and concise manner.   
   
Conclusion and outlook     
This last section should outline succinctly the results, present possible important applications of the work, suggestions for future research studies, and reflections on new challenges for the subject.   
   
### **References**   
   
Citation of literature references in the main text should be given at the appropriate place by the author's name followed by the year in parentheses (e.g., Smith, 2020). Should there be more than two authors, the first author's name should be followed by _et al._ (e.g., Johnson et al., 2019). When there are two or more papers by the same author(s) appearing in the same year, these should be distinguished by _a_, _b_, _c_, etc. after the year (e.g., Taylor, 2021a; Taylor, 2021b). Arranged in alphabetical order according to the first author, followed by the second author, then with all papers with more than two authors being arranged in chronological order (e.g., Brown, 2018; Davis et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022). Every reference cited in the text should appear in the list of references and vice versa. Literature references must be complete, including initials of author(s) cited, title of paper referred to, and title of journal, year, followed by volume and first and last pages of the article (e.g., Zhang J & Wang L. Study on climate change impacts. _Journal of Environmental Science 2019;_ 45(3): 230-245).

>    
> **_Web references:_** As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading if desired, or can be included in the reference list.   
   
**Mathematics and Symbols**     
You should take care when writing mathematical articles especially regarding subscripts and superscripts and differentiation between the letter 'l' and the figure one, C and c, S and s, k, K and other similar groups of letters. If your article contains superscripts or subscripts to superscripts or subscripts, take special care to ensure that the positioning of the characters is unambiguous. If special symbols are needed (e.g., Greek characters, accented characters or mathematical symbols) these should be typed using the appropriate TrueType font. Do not use the Symbol facility on the 'Insert' menu as this often results in font conversion problems. Equations must be prepared using Equation Editor or MathType.   
   
**Figures and Tables**     
You may illustrate your text by line diagrams and photographs. The figures should be clear, easy to read and of good quality. We accept maximum 7 figure per manuscript. We will normally use figures as submitted; it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that they are correct. Authors are required to provide a list of captions describing each figure and identifying the symbols used. The use of color in illustrations can enhance the effective presentation of results, and we are pleased to offer free reproduction of color illustrations in the electronic version of Journal of NeuroPhilosophy (JNphi). There is no charge for color reproduction of illustrations in the electronic version of the journal when the use of color is clearly required to further understanding and communication. Our preferred graphics formats are PNG, JPG, JPEG. These files can be used directly to give high quality results and file sizes are small in comparison with most bitmap forms.   
   
**Proofs**   
   
Proofs of articles are usually sent to you for correction by e-mail as an annotated Microsoft word \*.doc or \*.docx file attachment. When checking your proofs you should take particular care checking mathematics, tables and references. Only essential corrections should be made.   
   
**Acknowledgements**     
All contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should be listed in the ‘Acknowledgements’ section.   
   
**Funding**     
All sources of funding must be disclosed at the end of the main text under a separate heading ‘Funding’.    
   
###  **![](https://www.jneurophilosophy.com/public/site/images/anka/mceclip0-fe6a8714266b5eb919270905d1727ca7.png) OPINION AND PERSPECTIVES**   
   
Opinion and Perspectives should present a personal view on a topic within the scope of the journal. Keywords should be provided by the author(s). These articles may contain topical, historical or biographical information on relevant research, technologies and future research needs. Max 15 pages and 20 references.   
   
###  **![](https://www.jneurophilosophy.com/public/site/images/anka/mceclip0-fe6a8714266b5eb919270905d1727ca7.png) HYPOTHESIS AND THEORY**   
   
In hypothesis and theory articles, more new perspectives, perspectives that extend outside the box, will be especially preferred. A hypothesis is a fresh, unchallenged idea that a scientist proposes prior to conducting research. The purpose of a hypothesis is to provide a tentative explanation for an occurrence, an explanation that scientists can either support or disprove through experimentation. A hypothesis proposes a tentative explanation or prediction. A theory, on the other hand, is a substantiated explanation for an occurrence. Theories rely on tested and verified data, and scientists widely accepted theories to be true, though not unimpeachable. Max 15 pages and 20 references.   
   
###  **![](https://www.jneurophilosophy.com/public/site/images/anka/mceclip0-fe6a8714266b5eb919270905d1727ca7.png) REVIEW ARTICLES**   
   
Review articles should be complete, critical evaluations of the existing state of knowledge in a particular topic or area within the scope of the journal. Rather than a 'collage' of detailed information with a complete literature survey, a critically selected treatment of the material is desired; unsolved problems and possible developments should also be discussed. The introduction of a review article should primarily introduce the non-specialist to the subject as clearly as possible. A review should conclude with a section entitled 'Summary and outlook' in which the achievements of and new challenges for the subject are outlined succinctly. Length: a review article manuscript should consist of a maximum of 20 pages of text, footnotes, literature citations, tables and legend; there should be no more than 30 references.   
   
###  **![](https://www.jneurophilosophy.com/public/site/images/anka/mceclip0-fe6a8714266b5eb919270905d1727ca7.png) NEUROSCIENCE FOR PHILOSOPHERS**   
   
They are generally articles that deal with basic neuroscience concepts. These are articles that deal with the basics of neuroscience in simple language for philosophers who will come to this field. Max 15 pages, 20 references.   
   
###  **![](https://www.jneurophilosophy.com/public/site/images/anka/mceclip0-fe6a8714266b5eb919270905d1727ca7.png) PHILOSOPHY FOR NEUROSCIENTIST**   
   
In general, they are articles that deal with the history and concepts of basic philosophy, philosophy of mind perspectives, ancient ulsolved mind-brain/body problems and concepts in philosophy. The aim is to give new neuroscientists the habit of reading, learning and comprehending philosophy. Philosophy of mind concepts of philosophers in the history of philosophy can also be discussed. Max 15 pages, 20 references.
