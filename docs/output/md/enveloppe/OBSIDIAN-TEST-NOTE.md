# Test Note for Obsidian Integration   
   
This is a test to see if files created by Claude appear in your Obsidian vault.   
   
If you can see this note in Obsidian, then the integration is working and I can create more complex papers this way.   
   
**Created:** June 23, 2025     
**Location:** THEOPHYSICS vault, 01 Intro folder   
   
## Next Steps   
   
If this appears in Obsidian:   
   
- ✅ The filesystem integration is working   
- ✅ I can create proper THEOPHYSICS papers   
- ✅ The QW-01-01-REFINED paper should also be visible   
   
If this doesn't appear:   
   
- ❌ There's a path or permission issue   
- ❌ Obsidian needs manual refresh   
- ❌ We need to troubleshoot the MCP connection
