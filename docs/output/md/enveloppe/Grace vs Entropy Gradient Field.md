Vision and Purpose:   
This gradient field visualization demonstrates the dynamic interplay between grace and entropy as opposing forces in spiritual reality. The green area represents states where grace dominates, creating increasing order, while the red/orange area shows states where entropy dominates, leading to increasing disorder.   
The vector arrows indicate the direction and strength of the resultant force at each point in the field. Larger arrows near the entropy-dominant region show how disorder accelerates when unchecked, while the green arrows in the grace-dominant region show how spiritual restoration occurs when repentance is high.   
The white dashed circle marks the equilibrium point where G(Rₚ) = S, showing the delicate balance where grace and entropy cancel each other out. The equation G(Rₚ) = G₀·e^(Rₚ/S) at the bottom illustrates how grace grows exponentially with repentance, creating a powerful visual representation of how spiritual forces interact. This field visualization helps explain why small changes in repentance can lead to dramatic shifts in spiritual state when near critical thresholds.
