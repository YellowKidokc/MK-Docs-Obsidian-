## 🔗 CONTENT LAYERING STRATEGY   
   
### Tier 1: Public Content (Main Files)   
**Purpose**: Generate interest, establish credibility, drive premium subscriptions   
**Content**:    
   
- Core concepts explained simply   
- Basic scientific analogies   
- "For deeper analysis, see..." links   
- 2-3 introductory research questions   
- Cliffhanger endings that create curiosity   
   
**Example Structure**:   
```markdown
# JS-O1-Light-Main.md

## Introduction: Wave-Particle Duality of Faith
[Engaging explanation]

## Basic Scientific Foundation
[Accessible physics explanation]

## Spiritual Application
[Clear theological connection]

## Research Teasers
1. How does consciousness affect quantum measurement? 
2. Can spiritual "illumination" be modeled mathematically?
3. What are the coherence patterns in spiritual communities?

**🔬 For Advanced Research**: See [JS-O1-Light-Deep-Research.md]
**📊 For Mathematical Proofs**: See [JS-O1-Light-Mathematics.md]
