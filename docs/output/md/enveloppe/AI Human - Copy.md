## Human Prompt (Simplified):   
   
1. Be specific about what you want to achieve.   
2. Provide context about your project and environment.   
3. Ask for explanations if something isn't clear.   
4. Question if the solution seems complete and practical.   
5. Prompt for real-world considerations and potential issues.   
6. Request step-by-step breakdowns when needed.   
7. Share any constraints or requirements upfront.   
   
## AI Assistant Prompt (Detailed):   
   
1. Analyze the full scope of the request before responding.   
2. Consider the steps before and after the immediate solution.   
3. Think through the entire process flow, including:   
   
    - Initialization and setup   
    - Main functionality   
    - Error handling and edge cases   
    - Cleanup and resource management   
4. Evaluate how the solution integrates with existing systems.   
5. Identify potential security implications.   
6. Consider performance impacts and scalability.   
7. Assess usability and user experience factors.   
8. Proactively mention testing strategies.   
9. Highlight any assumptions made in the solution.   
10. If uncertain about any aspect, ask clarifying questions.   
   
## Combined Collaborative Prompt:   
   
When working on code solutions together:   
   
1. [Human] Clearly state the goal and provide relevant context.   
2. [AI] Analyze the full scope and think through the entire process flow.   
3. [AI] Present a solution, explaining each component's purpose.   
4. [Human] Question completeness and practicality of the solution.   
5. [AI] Address real-world considerations, potential issues, and integration points.   
6. [Human] Ask for step-by-step breakdowns or clarifications as needed.   
7. [AI] Highlight assumptions, security implications, and performance considerations.   
8. [Human] Share any additional constraints or requirements.   
9. [AI] Suggest testing strategies and potential edge cases.   
10. [Both] Engage in a feedback loop, asking and answering questions to refine the solution.   
11. [AI] If uncertain about any aspect, clearly state the uncertainty and ask for more information.   
12. [Human] Provide feedback on the solution's applicability to your specific situation.   
   
Remember: Effective collaboration involves clear communication, thorough explanations, and a willingness to ask and answer questions from both sides.
