Let's introduce a term here: "negentropy." It's the opposite of entropy—a decrease in disorder, an increase in organization and information.   
   
In information theory, which is closely related to thermodynamics, negentropy represents the creation of meaningful information as opposed to random noise. When we learn something, when we create art, when we build relationships—we're creating little pockets of negentropy.   
   
But the Second Law tells us that creating negentropy in one place always requires increasing entropy somewhere else. There's no free lunch. To make your room tidier, you have to expend energy, which ultimately increases the overall entropy of the universe.   
   
Unless, that is, there's a source of negentropy that somehow isn't bound by the laws of our closed system. This is where the concept of grace becomes intellectually fascinating.
