My sister has a manufacturing contacts in China you know that right that's where she makes her socks and things the company she sold to my niece they make plastic or chips they may have had no they don't make like chips but I imagine they make clothing clothing for sure or anything made out of material like compression socks and compression pants for diabetics OK But I imagine that she's got other contacts because they've made other things I mean I don't know what all they've made but those were the things that she actually bought to to own you know you want to say you're 15 ideas what you want to say you're 15 you know hole in the top   
   
There's no hole in the top here go a cord keeper that will keep my curling iron and my blow dryer Either a core keeper some way to keep my wires straight and I also have the same problem with wires at my desk and I don't like any of the things that are currently out there are just not neat and clean And in my bedroom I had the same problem as well on the floor so some of them are on the floor somewhere on top of the desk but there's basically wires everywhere OK Oh yes some way to keep the shower and the tub clean without having to scrub it I thought of that idea before yeah you tell what it is what it's like battery powered Shoots it on the top and let's roll down the bottom and stuff you know and somehow activates the water But I mean that that that'll be enough just I'm thinking more like a shower head with a soap that somehow feeds into it when you're not using it and and like it's programmed to like you know do the whole shower and then go rinse That's what I am that's better Maybe like a little maybe like a little scrubber like a pool thing from the bottom too the same thing that would be a good idea the shower thing is not I don't know how you would do the bottom but I'm sure we can figure it out I mean you just get like a little for triple A little yeah I mean they would be things that you probably like you know you like install it you know you would just like pick it up and use it and be like something you decide to put in there permanently because it would be a little bit of work change put the special head in it takes the soap that squirts the things the only problem is is yeah the soap to the thing it's like either it has to be powered or it has to work off of uh gravity right and the gravity would be the fiscal city of it wouldn't be too thick I'm sure they could figure that out Car wash is managed right OK what's your next time I like those what's your next idea I can't think of it now I should have wrote them down I mean I thought I wanted to simply the other night is just web hooks or emails or text messages depending on what plane you're on just scan sites for stuff like you know people got arrested or I don't know your name comes the dark web stuff like that but they've already got that but yeah they do in fact I heard about that on Hold it experienced today what they actually scan the dark web for your name and now they have something where when your social is used whether it be to get an apartment or credit or anything you are alerted when your social is used how they're doing that I don't know but that's pretty remarkable Good people are all over the dark web too I know what I'm having to do with pet for who's what I mean in general it's pet forever there   
   
   
   
That's very deep huh Baking hands rusty baking pans and baking sheets I don't know the solution I don't even know where to begin but it's a problem for many people if you open your bottom of your oven thing and perhaps this similar I mean not to that degree but he's got rusty ones but some way to I don't know prevent that or change is what we make them out of or Teflon but it's like how they but it flex off that's the thing with Teflon as it gets older it ends up in your food so it needs to be a better way I mean I don't know what it would be
