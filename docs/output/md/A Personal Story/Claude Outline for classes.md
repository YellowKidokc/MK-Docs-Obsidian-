4. Learning from mistakes:   
The story of your crypto trading experience, where a combination of high leverage, incorrect settings, and market conditions nearly wiped out your account, is a powerful cautionary tale. This anecdote can illustrate the importance of risk management, proper settings, and emotional control.   
   
5. Benefits of effectively managing emotions:
