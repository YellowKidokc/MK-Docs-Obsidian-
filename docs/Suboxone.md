title: '** all the time i''m like no Bart I''m not doing that he''s like why are you
  not doing I said it''s stupid Bart that''s the reason I''m not going to do it I
  go ahead and find me Bart go ahead And he I know I tested him And I love them I
  love them and I tried really hard but sometimes it was just like no I draw the line
  here but I draw yeah I told him I was like I was like you know what I was working
  at Macy''s I was like I work with strangers and you know what I do I do a great
  job like they promoted me within the first month and 1/2 of me being there I was
  on a computer fixing all the problems in my entire department and guess what nobody
  even stands over me right right And they''re not even my husband so you need to
  chill you know I thought some of that is part of the reason for this I mean it''s
  like like like like like everything everything everything to him was this world
  like you know II don''t know what happened I put it right here you know and I''m
  looking at him i''m like well it''s only me and you and I know I didn''t put it
  there and I know I didn''t have it today so like everything everything comes down
  to converges to that one point right and it''s like and I started thinking about
  it and it was like man like that that''s got to be stressful because he''s got to
  worry about everything all the time everywhere like I try to tell him I was like
  Bart like when I had my own business like dude do you I was like I didn''t touch
  the tools he''s like what do you mean I was like dude like the second day I was
  like you you control the tools when I want a tool you go grab it for me and when
  we get done the tools are rolled up I go I''m going to show you where I want them
  i''m going to show you what''s done and they better be there and II dumped off responsibility
  Bart I didn''t I didn''t take it on We would always go out and II keep everything
  organized you know and where he would be like just or just throw them in the back
  or just throw them unload them relievement behind the house or on the driveway I
  always make sure everything got put up and I was like everything to have its place
  00 yeah that that one that one''s bad that one is bad that''s that''s 1/3 of all
  fights Well he likes to be Where''s this yeah and even if it''s not where it belongs
  I can remember where we had it at last that''s a big deal i''m trying to be that
  I really have I really have yeah yeah and it''s work that yeah yeah I get it especially
  whenever especially whenever it''s not your stuff so you don''t pay attention to
  it so much you don''t know where it belongs because everything''s already such a
  mess There''s no organization you need organization before you can do that like
  I know and that''s another thing that''s all Bart I was like Bart I go this takes
  money and time I go like like I hate to say this but it''s like if you really want
  it this way you gotta pay for it or you gotta do it I was like every month one of
  my guys cleaned out my trailer and my truck it took it every month I had to pay
  him $100 to reorganize everything every month or make or just take the extra 10
  minutes at the end of the night right I think if it''s come or not leave the job
  or 10 minutes early whatever you know because sometimes a little stress to like
  finish a job and we''ll stay there until 10:00 at night and still don''t finish
  it so we could have left 30 minutes early and had everything unloaded where it belongs
  I mean just it''s a blessing and a curse but it''s like I mean that''s the reason
  ultimately I think that''s the reason he does attain our he does make that that
  that connection with the customers because he kills it I mean like nobody else will
  do what he does for as long as he does and they''re like there''s something in him
  you know and I''m like yeah he''s also very personable yeah no he is i''m not i''m
  not I''m like I''m like you know my sales pitch was like here''s the price can I
  give you my sales picture like sure you know and I''m like you know I have a company
  of three people and they all got families houses mortgages and you know we pay their
  bills so I don''t know if I''m higher or lower but my my price is my price and I''ll
  do a good job that was it yeah and that took me like a month to refine I mean I
  have it today still trained because that''s the only thing I said anyways yeah I
  know it I just got to the hospital I guess let me see if I can go back and talk
  to the nurse or someone will you ask for another thing would you ask if maybe I
  can write to him Yeah well I think that right now he''s just so he''s just stressed
  like they''re just trying to get him under control like he''s just losing his mind
  back there right now but yeah I mean he''s going to have to get I don''t even know
  if he could even I only go out there and try and see if I can see him I''ll call
  you back I''ll call you back as soon as I leave You don''t have to if you don''t
  want to but I love if you did but just take care of you after you take care of all
  this OK I will OK bye bye A lot of she didn''t know about your restaurant Is she
  using She did but I think that was the last time she said she said right when BAR
  got out I mean Bart said that before very shamefully but as far as I go you know
  was it was it was it a blessing you know that you got her in prison he''s like yeah
  but it was also a curse So basically right now he''s just trying to come out of
  something Academy didn''t sound like voluntarily didn''t sound like he was there
  voluntarily she''s not he wasn''t she said that I go he checked himself in voluntarily
  and she was like no So that''s either Misto Volvo or maybe her or I don''t think
  she said that but I think it was I think the cops took off she said the cops he
  was knocking on door shots some people about Jesus He was knocking on doors telling
  people about Jesus You know there was a time where I knocked on doors somebody stole
  some'

Is he told he swore to me that if it ever came down to it and he thought he was gonna do dope again or anything else he he he would go back on Suboxone and he didn't do it he never did it he just kept fighting and doing different things And I'm sure he doesn't want to be on Suboxone forever I so it's hard I mean I can't make a judgment against him because I get you know but I don't know that I wanna be on Suboxone forever either you know especially if you've already gotten off of it He's gonna get his head right you know you think that's possible or whatever yeah yeah I mean mine did mine went back to complete normal but it takes abstinence I mean you just have to sit with discomfort like this whole time I've been trying to tell him like if you lose all your customers lose them all I don't care barton I picked you up from prison 7 years ago and you didn't have one customer we built that we'll do it again I'll walk in the streets with you know I mean it that's no big deal let him go I kind of someone does the same thing III have to you have to you have to sit with this Like you have to sit through it there's no way around it So I kicks but I'm so mad but Monday though was OK monday was court was OK yes When today's Monday right yeah yeah yeah he had lawyers that went in there and that's OK yeah his attorney got the paper to sign to the paper to no no
I try to call a lot of places and II wasn't able to get a whole or II don't even do you know I mean not that it Matt what's the name of the place right hospital yeah he's at Hillcrest oh that's the one place that didn't call OK yeah Hillcrest Hospital in Tulsa it's in downtown OK and he's in the ER still for right now but they are going to admit him they just couldn't get him they couldn't do anything with him whenever he was like she said just two hours ago he was like losing his crap everywhere I don't even know what that looks like I mean I imagine it took a lot of people I might know he's a pretty big guy I know he can throw his weight around good too and he's like yeah we need about 6 more people in here boys especially like if he's having a manic episode I can't imagine super strength how was he when he got out of prison was he pretty focused and coherent and everything he was he was taking Suboxone through prison yeah he was already on Suboxone yeah but but he was good Like it was like he was good he he was pretty focused like he really liked me and I was strung out like I told you and he was like he never told me he never told me he never told me OK well I was really really bad bad bad he didn't really he talked bad about you but he didn't talk bad about you if you know what I mean So I was like a junkie I ended up in the hospital but no doctors could even they had to call it an anesthesiologist to come and put an IV in me because no one could get any names all my veins were trashed I tore myself up I was like a completely different person but he we used to talk to each other and I was like you only want to talk to me whenever you can see me and he was like like whenever I can video chat you he was like well I'm really sorry but I just I'm not going to be able to have you in my life when I get out of prison I already know and his words and I don't know what it was but it just freaking I was like I'm not that girl i'm not the girl who's bad for some dude in prison what the hell Get it together right but Bart is a rarity I'll give it to you I know I know so like it literally I quit that day I called my mom she came and got me it is all worked out and it blew his mind and we ended up together it was just really strange you know I mean he did say that God promised him something with you but I don't know so I don't know he always said that God promised something with you I don't know really what that means and I don't necessarily even care to know but he was standing on that and he believed it deeply so yeah I know maybe every cell is solace Well I guess I'm going to call up there like every few days or every week and then sooner or later I think he'd be able to call right I don't feel like it's going to take them too too long to get them straightened out I bet it's gonna be a month I bet it's going to be a month I don't think it's going to be a week really I was II mean who knows but yeah I would say so probably I mean like a weeks like yeah I don't know Something like that right like yeah to get it in there then it's two weeks and then they got to see X amount of time stable or something I don't know Yeah OK All right and also it depends on how agitated he is whenever he finds out that he's staying that might upset him even more because I know Barton is like he's he's definitely a go getter type of person like hands on OK talking to make notes you know like he likes he likes to well you know we work with him he likes to micromanage control everything Oh my God I mean I'm telling you we thought about that **** all the time i'm like no Bart I'm not doing that he's like why are you not doing I said it's stupid Bart that's the reason I'm not going to do it I go ahead and find me Bart go ahead And he I know I tested him And I love them I love them and I tried really hard but sometimes it was just like no I draw the line here but I draw yeah I told him I was like I was like you know what I was working at Macy's I was like I work with strangers and you know what I do I do a great job like they promoted me within the first month and 1/2 of me being there I was on a computer fixing all the

think she said that but I think it was I think the cops took off she said the cops he was knocking on door shots some people about Jesus He was knocking on doors telling people about Jesus You know there was a time where I knocked on doors somebody stole some **** in for my truck when I got kicked out of my own **** house and I jumped up on the **** truck on **** M 14 I was like come on here **** you know and then I started knocking on doors like get your **** **** out here i'm glad I took off because if I would have shot it that's the thing dude is you don't think at the moment no no no you do think it at the moment that's all you're thinking about and then that thinking brings action and like with me it ramps up fast on I mean it ramps up fast I have murderous **** thoughts you know you don't I was gonna shoot the **** **** that stole the **** for me I don't give a **** what it was I'm telling you I'm knocked on every **** door and called them all **** out you know I'll do without a **** guy I did that without a gun Yeah just **** really I mean maybe 100 bucks worth of stupid **** like you know I don't even remember but it wasn't my night shift or nothing but yeah II did a **** Denzel Washington got off top of my **** truck**** I was like come out of here you know**** I get in that mode dude Again in that mode I felt like the whole time Bart were like one of the really I mean like after listening to Beau Bo's got the bad story I mean Bo's really never said nothing bad about war i've always said tons of bad **** about like I'm like but like let's not get this twisted like I love it like a brother but the reason I love you like a brother is I get to tell other people **** about you that I don't like you know But Bo never really said anything and Bo went on for like three hours today and I was like **** you know it's just there's a lot of deception I mean tell me this don't seem like a drug addict both said you know he'd sleep all the time right when he came out of his sleep he said he'd wake up and he'd go to his truck for about 2 1/2 to 34 hours right and then he'd take off somewhere for about 2 hours and when he came back in he was like let's go you know it's one out of 5 and **** around and **** and then he said you know then started the site and then he went to go to sleep for a long time and then he crashed there starts to cycle And I'm saying all this and I'm doing drugs right I mean II can claim higher authority by anyone so you know there's like two or three times where Bart really opened up his heart and told me what he was going through those two or three times when I should have told him the exact same thing and I promised myself I would I promised myself I would right Like right in that right moment I mean II can justify it any way I want but I didn't want to **** upset him and not but you know then I was like OK then I'm just quitting I won't go through this **** with him you know with him at not knowing but I'm going to you know and then I guess my addiction was bigger I mean in a way he's a lot stronger than I was admitted to and told me And then No I'm starting to think of you know I'm starting to form a theory on this
