# Quantum Consciousness Overview

The [[Unified Field Hypothesis]] connects classical theophysics with
state-dependent consciousness experiments.  Key assumptions include the
relationship between \( \psi \) collapse and sacred geometry.

==Key findings== are summarised below.

!!! info
    Field resonance aligns with \( \alpha = 7.32 \times 10^{-3} \).

```python
#!python
def collapse_wave(function, intent):
    return function.entangle(intent).collapse()
```
